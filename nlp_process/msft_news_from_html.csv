I got to talk about and bring up Microsoft here this morning and of course slumping just a little bit the broader markets are pulling back given some of the tensions in the Middle East and uh of course that naturally throws a wrench in some of the recent uh highs that we've bumped back up against. But for Microsoft here, what's core to the driver that is really going to have investors swooning over this stock for for years to come?
Yeah, so Microsoft is offense and defense, right? In in terms of their core business is the enterprise business. That business is going to be much more resilient than a consumer business that may be impacted by any shifts in the economy or or disruptions to the economy. So that makes them the most stable of of the mega caps. But then there's also offense. They have the fastest growing hyper scalar. Azure grew 35%. They're growing so fast, they have to offload demand into smaller hyper scalars. They are at the center of what's happening in AI. They have been for a couple of years. They had a little bit of a hitch towards the end of last year, the beginning of this year, but they've re-emerged even more victorious. So that's why they're the best performing uh of the mega caps and we believe they'll continue to be the best performer.
Uh Joe, I only got about 30 seconds here, but as you're thinking about Microsoft and the mega cap stocks right now, even amid some of the geopolitical tension that we've been tracking and and the breakout of even more conflict in the Middle East, does that make some of these mag seven stocks even more attractive as even though it is an overcrowded trade right now, it seems like that is one of the new defensive plays, if you will.
Yeah, Microsoft, Amazon, to a certain extent, meta, these are companies that are in very good shape, have been performing well, are more resilient, more diversified across several businesses and and have a more limited impact from the consumer than maybe some some other stocks or or cyclical stocks in the economy. So we do believe that they will uh be somewhat of a shelter to the extent that there's even more disruption."

Economic data releases and earnings
Nearly halfway through 2025, it's clear the stock market has a different character than in the past two years, in which it seemed the same story played out twice.
In 2023 and 2024, investorschampioned the rise of the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks, leading to a historically low number of S&P 500 (^GSPC) constituents outperforming the broader index. This year, things are looking more normal relative to market history.
Through June 11, roughly 46% of companies in the benchmark index were sitting on year-to-date gains that topped the S&P 500's 2.6% gain.
Richard Bernstein Advisors CEO Richard Bernstein said in an interview this week that all investors should hope the broadening continues, because it means ""the health of the broader economy is improving.""
Across the S&P 500's 11 sectors, seven have outperformed the index this year, led by a more than 9% rise for Industrials (XLI) and a 7% pop for Utilities (XLU).
The Magnificent Seven tech stockshave contributed significantly to the market's most recent leg higher in the past month. But zoom out to the full year, and the cohort is a clear laggard.
Research from Exhibit A co-founder Matt Cerminaronotes that as of June 11, the Magnificent Seven index, which includes Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA), has fallen 2.51% in 2025. By comparison, the other 493 stocks in the S&P 500 have risen 5.32%.
Aswe highlighted late last month, the current market backdrop has grown more favorable for stock pickers, with stocks beginning to move on their own accord —rather than in a large group depending on the president's Truth Social posts— as peak tariff uncertainty subsides.
AIremains a key theme for investorsin that environment, but not all of this year's biggest winners are tied to this transformative technology, another break from years past.
AI and defense darling Palantir (PLTR) is the year's biggest winner in the index, rising 80%. But the balance of the top 10 best-performing stocks flaunts a more diverse group, featuring energy names like NRG Energy (NRG), gold plays like Newmont (NEM), and discount retailer Dollar General (DG).
And while companies like GE Vernova (GEV) and CVS (CVS) might not light up the conversation at a cocktail party, Bernstein notes that this broader participation is likely a good sign for markets moving forward."
Analysis-Meta's $14.8 billion Scale AI deal latest test of AI partnerships,"(Reuters) -Facebook owner Meta's $14.8 billion investment in Scale AI and hiring of the data-labeling startup's CEO will test how the Trump administration views so-called acquihire deals, which some have criticized as an attempt to evade regulatory scrutiny.

(Reuters) -Facebook owner Meta's $14.8 billion investment in Scale AI and hiring of the data-labeling startup's CEO will test how the Trump administration views so-called acquihire deals, which some have criticized as an attempt to evade regulatory scrutiny.
The deal, announced on Thursday, was Meta's second-largest investment to date. It gives the owner of Facebook a 49% nonvoting stake in Scale AI, which uses gig workers to manually label data and includes among its customers Meta competitors Microsoft and ChatGPT creator OpenAI.
Unlike an acquisition or a transaction that would give Meta a controlling stake, the deal does not require a review by U.S. antitrust regulators. However, they could probe the deal if they believe it was structured to avoid those requirements or harm competition.
The deal appeared to be structured to avoid potential pitfalls, such as cutting off competitors' access to Scale's services or giving Meta an inside view into rivals' operations - though Reuters exclusively reported on Friday that Alphabet's Google has decided to sever ties with Scale in light of Meta's stake, and other customers are looking at taking a step back.
In a statement, a Scale AI spokesperson said its business, which spans work with major companies and governments, remains strong, as it is committed to protecting customer data. The company declined to comment on specifics with Google.
Alexandr Wang, Scale's 28-year-old CEO who is coming to Meta as part of the deal, will remain on Scale's board but will have appropriate restrictions placed around his access to information, two sources familiar with the move confirmed.
Large tech companies likely perceive the regulatory environment for AI partnerships as easier to navigate under President Donald Trump than under former President Joe Biden, said William Kovacic, director of the competition law center at George Washington University.
Trump's antitrust enforcers have said they do not want to regulate how AI develops, but have also displayed a suspicion of large tech platforms, he added.
""That would lead me to think they will keep looking carefully at what the firms do. It does not necessarily dictate that they will intervene in a way that would discourage the relationships,"" Kovacic said.
Federal Trade Commission probes into past ""aquihire"" deals appear to be at a standstill. Under the Biden administration, the FTC opened inquiries into Amazon's deal to hire top executives and researchers from AI startup Adept, and Microsoft's $650 million deal with Inflection AI. The latter allowed Microsoft to use Inflection's models and hire most of the startup's staff, including its co-founders."

AMD shares have lost 3.9% in the year-to-date period, underperforming the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s increase of 2.5% and the Zacks Computer – Integrated Systems industry’s growth of 16.4%.The underperformance can be attributed to increasing macroeconomic challenges and uncertainty, which are attributed to higher tariffs.  Export controls on certain Instinct GPUs to China posed a regulatory challenge.

CoreWeave Guides $4.9-$5.1B in 2025 Revenues: What's Fueling This?,CRWV guides 2025 revenues to be in the range of $4.9-$5.1 billion as AI infrastructure demand and strategic deal wins fuel momentum.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coreweave-guides-4-9-5-144700210.html,,MSFT,['CRWV'],2025-06-13T14:47:00.000Z,,,"CoreWeave, Inc.CRWV has guided 2025 revenues to be in the range of $4.9-$5.1 billion, fueled by surging AI-infrastructure demand. CRWV is an AI-focused hyperscaler company and its cloud platform has been developed to scale, support and accelerate GenAI. Businesses have been increasing spending on AI inference/fine-tuning, AI workload monitoring and training infrastructure, including training compute, AI servers, AI storage, cloud workloads and networking. This increasing demand for AI-cloud platforms, including integrated software and infrastructure, bodes well for CRWV.
Strategic deal wins like the OpenAI contract (which has a value up to $11.9 billion) and a $4 billion expansion with a major AI-enterprise client are driving forward revenue visibility. The company also unveiled the next generation of its CoreWeave AI object storage. This is purpose-built for training and inference, offering a production-ready, scalable solution integrated with Kubernetes.
CoreWeave now boasts a growing network with 33 data centers across the United States and Europe, supported by 420 megawatts of active power. Moreover, the buyout of the Weights and Biases has added 1,400 AI labs and enterprises as clients for CoreWeave. Apart from scaling capacity and getting adequate financing for infrastructure, CRWV is also expanding its go-to-market capabilities.
With a success-based capex model and expanding global reach, CoreWeave appears well-positioned to capture a significant share of the AI-infrastructure market. On the first quarter earnings call, CRWV highlighted that AI is forecasted to have a global economic impact of $20 trillion by 2030, while the total addressable market is anticipated to increase to $400 billion by 2028.
This uptrend in spending will benefit other players in this space, including smaller players likeNebius Group N.V.NBIS and tech behemoths likeMicrosoft CorporationMSFT.
Driven by accelerating demand for its AI-infrastructure services, Nebius remains confident in achieving the full-year annualized run-rate revenue (“ARR”) guidance of $750 million to $1 billion. For 2025, the company also reaffirmed its overall revenue guidance of $500 million to $700 million. In the first quarter of 2025, ARR saw a 700% jump, highlighting a structurally expanding revenue base. ARR for April was $310, which provides a strong start for the second quarter. To gain a larger share of the AI-cloud compute market, NBIS is focusing on technical enhancements that increase reliability and reduce downtime to boost customer retention."
SoundHound's Amelia 7.0 Launch: A Turning Point for Voice AI?,"SOUN unveils Amelia 7.0, shifting from reactive assistants to autonomous voice AI agents amid soaring revenue growth.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/soundhounds-amelia-7-0-launch-143700831.html,,MSFT,['SOUNW'],2025-06-13T14:37:00.000Z,,,"SoundHound AI’s SOUN rollout of Amelia 7.0, unveiled on May 8, marks a significant milestone, shifting its voice AI suite from reactive assistants to fully agentic, voice-enabled AI agents that understand, reason and act autonomously. Built on the proprietary Agentic+ framework, these agents offer a hybrid of deterministic flows and generative AI. This enables them to complete multi-step tasks, like reordering prescriptions or resetting passwords, without human intervention.Technically, Amelia 7.0 integrates Polaris ASR, delivering low latency and 99% intent recognition accuracy, alongside seamless LLM interoperability and enterprise-grade guardrails. This positions SoundHound not just as a voice AI player, but as a leader in agentic AI, a rapidly emergent category poised for exponential adoption across industries.The timing is strategic. During the first quarter of 2025, SoundHound’s revenue jumped 151% year over year to $29.1 million, supported by expanded voice commerce in restaurants and automotive integrations. Though slightly below expectations, the company maintained strong guidance ($157–177 million for 2025), backed by a record pipeline and $246 million in cash with no debt.Amelia 7.0 could be a catalyst, offering defenses against commoditization in speech-to-text markets and unlocking new revenue streams via autonomous agents in healthcare, finance, customer service, and more. Still, SoundHound must convert technological leadership into clear monetization, maintain competitive gross margins, and scale enterprise adoption amid macroeconomic pressures.Amelia 7.0 is a transformative leap. If SoundHound can translate this tech into scale, the stock could enjoy a strong re-rating. However, execution is key, especially in proving ROI and driving profitable growth across diverse verticals.
As SoundHound pushes forward with Amelia 7.0, it faces mounting competition from both established tech giants and specialized AI players, who are also sculpting the voice AI frontier.Microsoft CorporationMSFT, through its Azure OpenAI integrations and Nuance Communications unit, remains a formidable force. Nuance’s deep roots in healthcare voice automation and conversational AI give Microsoft a strong enterprise footprint. By embedding large language models into voice-enabled workflows, Microsoft is targeting the same high-value verticals, like finance and call centers, that SoundHound seeks to disrupt.Alphabet Inc.’s GOOGL Google, with its Assistant and Vertex AI platforms, is another heavyweight rival. Google Assistant is already embedded in millions of devices, and Vertex AI provides developers with customizable voice agents powered by Google's advanced speech-to-text and LLM models. Its scalability and ecosystem—spanning Android, Smart Home, and Workspace—present a serious challenge to SoundHound’s adoption in consumer and enterprise environments."

"Wells Fargo sees second-half rebound for software stocks, upgrades Zscaler","Investing.com -- Wells Fargo expects software stocks to rebound in the second half of the year as macroeconomic concerns ease and enterprise technology budgets normalize, but recommends investors remain selective through the summer.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wells-fargo-sees-second-half-131056823.html,,MSFT,['ZS'],2025-06-13T13:10:56.000Z,,,"Investing.com -- Wells Fargo expects software stocks to rebound in the second half of the year as macroeconomic concerns ease and enterprise technology budgets normalize, but recommends investors remain selective through the summer.
In a mid-year update, the bank said volatility marked the first half of 2025, with tech shares swinging sharply and investor frustration mounting over the slow contribution from artificial intelligence.The firm noted its coverage has broadly returned to end-2024 levels, despite gains in major indexes like the NASDAQ Composite and iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (NYSE:IGV).
A survey conducted by Wells Fargo pointed to weaker IT spending growth in the first half, up just 2% year-on-year, but highlighted continued resilience in cloud infrastructure, cybersecurity, and generative AI initiatives, particularly in customer service.Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) emerged as the top vendor, with over half of respondents expecting to increase spend.
AI revenue monetization remains limited across most of software, the note said, but activity in the data space is picking up, with new SaaS data platforms and acquisitions gaining momentum.Wells Fargo raised its price targets on Microsoft and Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW).
The bank sees better seasonal demand benefiting smaller-cap software names in the second half, and upgraded Kenvue (NYSE:KVUE) to Overweight and DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU) to Equal Weight, while downgrading Dayforce and GitLab.It continues to favor companies undergoing business model transitions, including SAP and Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK).
Wells Fargo upgraded Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS) to Overweight and raised its price target to $385, citing the company’s potential to reach $5 billion in annual recurring revenue by fiscal 2027.The bank expects over 20% billings growth in fiscal 2026 and sees margin expansion continuing alongside revenue growth.Zscaler’s shares, it said, remain undervalued relative to peers like CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD).
