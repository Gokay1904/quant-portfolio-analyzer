Economic data releases and earnings
Nearly halfway through 2025, it's clear the stock market has a different character than in the past two years, in which it seemed the same story played out twice.
In 2023 and 2024, investorschampioned the rise of the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks, leading to a historically low number of S&P 500 (^GSPC) constituents outperforming the broader index. This year, things are looking more normal relative to market history.
Through June 11, roughly 46% of companies in the benchmark index were sitting on year-to-date gains that topped the S&P 500's 2.6% gain.
Richard Bernstein Advisors CEO Richard Bernstein said in an interview this week that all investors should hope the broadening continues, because it means ""the health of the broader economy is improving.""
Across the S&P 500's 11 sectors, seven have outperformed the index this year, led by a more than 9% rise for Industrials (XLI) and a 7% pop for Utilities (XLU).
The Magnificent Seven tech stockshave contributed significantly to the market's most recent leg higher in the past month. But zoom out to the full year, and the cohort is a clear laggard.
Research from Exhibit A co-founder Matt Cerminaronotes that as of June 11, the Magnificent Seven index, which includes Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA), has fallen 2.51% in 2025. By comparison, the other 493 stocks in the S&P 500 have risen 5.32%.
Aswe highlighted late last month, the current market backdrop has grown more favorable for stock pickers, with stocks beginning to move on their own accord —rather than in a large group depending on the president's Truth Social posts— as peak tariff uncertainty subsides.
AIremains a key theme for investorsin that environment, but not all of this year's biggest winners are tied to this transformative technology, another break from years past.
AI and defense darling Palantir (PLTR) is the year's biggest winner in the index, rising 80%. But the balance of the top 10 best-performing stocks flaunts a more diverse group, featuring energy names like NRG Energy (NRG), gold plays like Newmont (NEM), and discount retailer Dollar General (DG).
And while companies like GE Vernova (GEV) and CVS (CVS) might not light up the conversation at a cocktail party, Bernstein notes that this broader participation is likely a good sign for markets moving forward.",positive,1
Why Apple (AAPL) Dipped More Than Broader Market Today,"Apple (AAPL) reached $196.45 at the closing of the latest trading day, reflecting a -1.38% change compared to its last close.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-apple-aapl-dipped-more-214502072.html,,AAPL,[],2025-06-13 21:45:02+00:00,,,"Apple (AAPL) closed at $196.45 in the latest trading session, marking a -1.38% move from the prior day. This move lagged the S&P 500's daily loss of 1.13%. At the same time, the Dow lost 1.79%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 1.3%.
The maker of iPhones, iPads and other products's shares have seen a decrease of 5.79% over the last month, not keeping up with the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 7.36% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.55%.
The investment community will be paying close attention to the earnings performance of Apple in its upcoming release. The company's upcoming EPS is projected at $1.41, signifying a 0.71% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $88.31 billion, showing a 2.95% escalation compared to the year-ago quarter.
Regarding the entire year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates forecast earnings of $7.11 per share and revenue of $404.19 billion, indicating changes of +5.33% and +3.36%, respectively, compared to the previous year.
Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Apple should also be noted by investors. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the business health and profitability.
Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-term stock moves. To take advantage of this, we've established the Zacks Rank, an exclusive model that considers these estimated changes and delivers an operational rating system.
The Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.15% lower. Apple presently features a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).
In the context of valuation, Apple is at present trading with a Forward P/E ratio of 28. This represents a premium compared to its industry average Forward P/E of 11.06.
One should further note that AAPL currently holds a PEG ratio of 2.22. The PEG ratio is akin to the commonly utilized P/E ratio, but this measure also incorporates the company's anticipated earnings growth rate. By the end of yesterday's trading, the Computer - Micro Computers industry had an average PEG ratio of 1.48.
The Computer - Micro Computers industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 95, finds itself in the top 39% echelons of all 250+ industries.",positive,1
Apple's $4.4B India Play: The Secret iPhone Shift That's Reshaping U.S. Supply Chains,"As Trump targets China, Apple quietly reroutes billions in iPhone exports through India--and it's just getting started",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apples-4-4b-india-play-210646717.html,,AAPL,['HNHPF'],2025-06-13 21:06:46+00:00,,,"Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) isrampingup its India productionand fast. From January through May 2025, Foxconn (FXCOF) shipped $4.4 billion worth of India-assembled iPhones to the U.S., already beating 2024's full-year total of $3.7 billion. Between March and May, a staggering 97% of Foxconn's $3.2 billion exports went straight to the U.S., compared to just 50% last year. The push isn't subtle: Apple has been flying out iPhone 13, 14, 16, and 16e models on chartered planes and pressing Indian officials to cut customs clearance at Chennai airport from 30 hours down to six.
Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Sign with MSFT.
This shift comes as Apple looks to de-risk from China ahead of what could be another round of sweeping tariffs. Donald Trump has floated a 55% duty on Chinese goods and slammed Apple's expansion into India, reportedly telling CEO Tim Cook, We are not interested in you building in India. India, meanwhile, is trying to dodge a separate 26% reciprocal tariff on top of its standard 10%. With the stakes this high, Apple's move to reroute its supply chain through India could be less about costand more about survival. It's also about time. Apple still sells 60 million iPhones a year in the U.S., with about 80% made in China.
Tata Electronics, Apple's smaller Indian partner, is also stepping up. Nearly 86% of its March and April shipments went to the U.S., up from 52% across 2024. Analysts at Counterpoint Research believe India-made iPhones could hit 2530% of Apple's global shipments this yearup from just 18% in 2024. But India's still an expensive bet. High import duties on components make local assembly far from cheap. Still, Apple appears willing to absorb the extra costs in exchange for agility. The numbers suggest this isn't a trial run. It's a full pivot.

The requests cover mobile phones, cases, battery chargers and wireless telephone services, as well as potentially retail stores. The applications with the US Patent and Trademark Office were filed on Thursday, according to a public database.
A spokesperson for the Trump Organization didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
“While a trademark filing doesn’t guarantee a product launch, the specificity of the applications points to serious consideration,” Josh Gerben, a trademark attorney and founder of Gerben IP law firm, wrote in a blog post on Friday.
The filings suggest plans could be in the works for a Trump-branded mobile phone or service to compete with Verizon Communications Inc., AT&T Inc. and T-Mobile US Inc., Gerben wrote.
“It would mark a significant expansion for Trump’s private business, which has historically focused on real estate, hospitality, and branded merchandise,” he said.

Apple’s Liquid Glass design is paving the way for AR glasses,"This visual overhaul gives us a glimpse into the design of Apple's rumored AR glasses, which will reportedly debut next year.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-liquid-glass-design-paving-180015528.html,,AAPL,[],2025-06-13 18:00:15+00:00,,,"At Apple’sWWDC 2025event, the company announced its most dramatic software design change in over a decade:Liquid Glass.This visual overhaul gives us a glimpse into what might be coming in Apple’srumored AR glasses, which will reportedly debutnext year.
Users are connecting Liquid Glass to potential AR glasses because the new design draws strong inspiration from that ofApple’s Vision Pro VR headset.
Liquid Glass is named with the idea that each window on a phone is like a pane of glass, see-through and somewhat reflective. It gives the screen a sleeker look, though in its developer beta, Apple hasn’t quiteworked out the kinksof playing with opacity.
The Vision Pro wasn’t much of a commercial success — it cost $3,500, and unlike a computer, it isn’t something that has proven essential for our lives. But nonetheless, the UX design of the Vision Pro is impressive because it makes wearing a headset feel a bit less disorienting.
It can feel unnatural to be so immersed in virtual reality for an extended period of time, so Apple took advantage of its mixed reality capabilities by overlaying windows atop a user’s real-world surroundings, rather than a synthetic background.
Apple may not be able to convince people that they need a $3,500 headset, but to keep up with competitors like Meta’sRay-Bansand Google’srenewed attemptat smart glasses, Apple needs to enter the arena of this lighter hardware. And one of Apple’s strengths as a company — something that sets it apart from Meta and Google — is that it’s known for elegant, modern designs (except for “the notch“).
According to reports from Bloomberg’sMark Gurman, these glasses would have cameras, microphones, and speakers like its competitors. Siri — which is still awaitingits own makeover— would be built-in, and could assist with taking phone calls, playing music,live translation, and turn-by-turn directions. On a display, users would be able to see notifications, pictures, and other overlays.
If that’s the case, then Apple will need to master the style of these somewhat transparent design elements. If you’re wearing AR glasses and get some form of notification, you’d probably rather see that as something that blends into your surroundings, and not some giant colorful box that suddenly obscures your vision while you’re walking around.
We don’t know much about the rumored Apple AR glasses yet, but we’d be willing to bet we’ll see Liquid Glass in them.",neutral,0

The lawsuit, targeting their alleged suppression of lawful competition in standalone Wi-Fi Calling, comes amidst Apple's introduction of several updates across its product lines, including significant enhancements in iPadOS, iOS, and macOS. Despite these developments, Apple's share price moved by a modest 2% last week. This reflects the broader market dynamics, including the Dow's significant decline due to geopolitical tensions, demonstrating that Apple's movement aligns with wider market trends rather than being solely driven by company-specific events.
Be aware that Apple is showing 1 possible red flag in our investment analysis.
Find companies with promising cash flow potential yet trading below their fair value.
Apple’s recent legal challenge from VoIP-Pal.com Inc. could impact its operational focus and financial metrics. While the lawsuit's direct effects are yet to be fully realized, it might introduce legal costs and potential changes in business practices that could affect revenue and earnings forecasts. Specifically, if Apple were to face adverse rulings, it may have to adjust its business practices or pricing, potentially impacting service revenue streams. The market's reaction, with only a modest share price movement, suggests that the impact might not be deemed significant unless more developments arise.
Over a longer five-year period, Apple has delivered a total return of 134.39%, significantly rewarding its shareholders. This context highlights a strong performance, even if, in the last year, the stock underperformed the US market, which returned 11.7%. This discrepancy raises questions about recent pressures on the stock compared to broader market dynamics.
The current share price movement should also be evaluated in light of analyst price targets, which are approximately 14.5% higher than the present value. This discount signals that analysts might expect Apple to navigate current challenges and achieve its growth targets. Such a target anticipates that planned U.S. facility expansions and new product launches, such as the iPhone 16e, will drive revenue and earnings growth. However, the broader macroeconomic conditions and legal outcomes are potential uncertainties.

Apple stock could catch a short-term bid with cheap valuation: Morgan Stanley,"Investing.com -- Apple shares may benefit from short-term upside as deep discounting in China fuels stronger-than-expected iPhone and iPad sales, according to Morgan Stanley.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-stock-could-catch-short-171251954.html,,AAPL,[],2025-06-13 17:12:51+00:00,,,"Investing.com -- Apple shares may benefit from short-term upside as deep discounting in China fuels stronger-than-expected iPhone and iPad sales, according to Morgan Stanley.
“iPhone and iPad sell-through in China are positively surprising this quarter thanks to 618 Festival promotion momentum,” Morgan Stanley analysts wrote, adding that the trend suggests “up to $4B June revenue upside vs. MSe, all else equal.”
“Specifically, we now see ~3.0M units of upside to our June quarter iPhone shipments and ~2.5M units of upside to our June quarter iPad shipments,” the bank stated.
China’s 618 Festival promotions and national subsidies are said to have been key drivers, leading to “very strong” iPhone sell-through for three consecutive weeks.
The bank’s Greater China Tech Hardware team now estimates 46.5 million iPhone builds and 14.5 million iPad builds in the June quarter, representing year-over-year growth of 19% and 38%, respectively.
That’s up from prior estimates of 45 million iPhones and 13 million iPads.
Using historical seasonal relationships between builds and shipments, Morgan Stanley projects iPhone shipments to hit 49 million, which is “7% above MSe of 46.0M units, and 8% above Consensus at 45.2M.”
For iPads, they now see 14.7 million shipments, “20% above MSe of 12.3M units, and 12% above Consensus.”
While near-term Services growth uncertainty remains a concern for investors, Morgan Stanley stated: “Estimate upside is typically accompanied by multiple expansion, so watch for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to potentially catch a short-term bid given the stock is trading towards the lower-end of its 24-32x P/E range over the last 2 years.”

Unlike peers such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google (GOOG), Apple has not signalled large-scale AI infrastructure investments. The recent iPhone upgrade cycle appears subdued: iPhone revenue was about $46.8 billion in the latest quarter, roughly 2% higher year on year, suggesting limited upside from incremental AI features.
Apple's Services segment faces fresh headwinds after losing an appeal in the Epic Games App Store case, which may pressure commission revenues. Wearables also saw softer growth despite Vision Pro contributions, highlighting potential challenges in key growth areas.
Valuation remains rich: Apple trades at about 27.6 times expected earnings for the current fiscal year and around 25.3 times for next year, while peers carry lower multiples with stronger EPS momentum. Buybacks may have less impact at these levels.
Investors are likely to monitor whether Apple ramps AI spending to catch up or relies on its ecosystem to monetize future services. With other big tech doubling down on AI, Apple's ability to pivot may be critical for sustaining growth and justifying its premium valuation.

While devices are essential for expanding Roku-powered households, the segment continues to face financial strain, with persistent losses and margin pressure. Roku maintains that its priority is growing its streaming footprint, even at the cost of short-term Devices profits.These trends are expected to continue. For the second quarter of 2025, Roku projects Devices revenues to decline around 10% year over year, with margins staying negative. To manage macro and tariff-related risks, the company is leaning on its diversified manufacturing and flexible pricing. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Roku’s second quarter 2025 revenues of the Devices segment is pegged at $124.42 million and the estimate for the gross loss of the segment is pegged at $14.06 million.To improve brand appeal and deepen engagement, Roku recently launched a refreshed device lineup. The updated Roku-made TVs feature better picture and sound quality, faster app launches and deeper bass. The new Pro Series introduces QLED and Mini-LED technology, along with an upgraded Voice Remote Pro and software features like Smart Picture and personalized Backdrops.Despite similar efforts in the past, profitability remains elusive. In the first quarter of 2025, Devices revenues rose 11% year over year to $140 million (13.7% of total revenues), but the segment posted a gross loss of $19 million and a negative 14% margin due to lingering holiday promotions. While unit sales were strong, the Devices business continues to function as a long-term strategic lever rather than a near-term profit engine.

President Donald Trump’s tariff regime may not be having the desired effect of bringing manufacturing back to the US yet, but it’s making companies sound a lot more patriotic.
At least that’s what executives are projecting during earnings calls.
During first-quarter conferences, they touted their “Made in America” credentials or domestic production capabilities at a record rate, with firms in the S&P 500 Index calling out their domestic production over 200 times, compared with a 25-year average of around 50 mentions per earnings season, according to data compiled by Bloomberg News.
Talk is cheap, though, much cheaper than actually investing in the US. Despite the patriotic enthusiasm, there’s little evidence corporate America has broken ground on new domestic facilities.
“There have been anecdotal announcements from drug companies, or otherwise, talking about investments here in the US,” Brent Thielman, who covers the construction and engineering industries for DA Davidson & Co., said in an interview. “But when that comes to fruition remains to be seen.”
Altogether, companies ranging from Apple Inc. and International Business Machines Corp. to Eli Lilly & Co. and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. have pledged hundreds of billions of dollars of spending in the US since Trump’s election. Many of those commitments weren’t new or were in line with previous spending patterns.
Touting new projects in response to tariffs could appear reactive, while highlighting projects already underway is a savvy way to calm investors in uncertain times, said Emily Borders, chief client officer at Highwire, a public relations agency.
“It’s very difficult to set up a ‘Made in the USA’ program overnight. In fact, you can’t do that,” Borders said. “However, many organizations have been doing really interesting things in that regard or have had initiatives in that regard for a while and those may not have been top of mind with some of their constituencies.”
Like some of those investment announcements, touting your domestic production bona fides could have the added benefit of keeping the heat from the White House at bay, though that’s not a certainty.",neutral,0

May alone saw about $1 billion of India-made iPhones land stateside, the second-largest monthly tally after March's $1.3 billion, according to customs data. In the first five months of 2025, Foxconn has sent $4.4 billion worth of devices from India to Americaalready surpassing the full-year 2024 total of $3.7 billion.
Apple CEO Tim Cook told investors that most iPhones sold in the June quarter in the U.S. would be built in India, part of a broader push to diversify manufacturing beyond China. Foxconn's plants and Tata Electronics' three South India facilitieswhere 86% of their March-April output also went to the U.S.are central to that strategy. Apple has even lobbied Chennai airport officials to cut customs clearance times from 30 hours to six, smoothing the export pipeline.
While India faces its own tariff negotiationsa baseline 10% import duty and a paused 26% surcharge proposed by the Trump administrationApple's shift underscores how global supply chains are realigning around tariff arbitrage. In parallel, former President Trump has threatened 25% levies on iPhones not made in the U.S. and floated 55% duties on Chinese goods, highlighting the political stakes.
Why It Matters: With India becoming a primary export hub for U.S. iPhone sales, Apple could trim tariff drag and fortify its supply resiliencebut must navigate evolving duties and geopolitical headwinds.

Apple Grabs China iPhone Crown in May,Global shipments up 15% as U.S. and China drive growth,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-grabs-china-iphone-crown-132022942.html,,AAPL,[],2025-06-13 13:20:22+00:00,,,"Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)snagged the top spotfor iPhone sales in China in May as global shipments climbed 15% year-over-year in April and May, Counterpoint Research data shows.
The rebound in Apple's two biggest marketsChina and the U.S.drove much of the gain, with China Academy of Information and Communications Technology figures backing up Counterpoint's findings: April foreign-brand phone shipments in China rose to 3.52 million units from 3.50 million a year earlier.
Beyond North America and Greater China, Apple saw double-digit growth in Japan, India and Middle Eastern markets, reflecting successful tariff-dodge strategies and robust demand for its latest models.
Counterpoint senior analyst Ivan Lam said Q2 looks promising but warned that swings either way are dictated by the U.S. and China, underscoring Apple's reliance on those two regions.
Despite soaring sales, Apple still faces stiff competition from Huawei, vivo and other domestic brands that have ramped up marketing and value-priced handsets in China. Revenue impact hinges on whether Apple can sustain momentum against local rivals and manage its premium pricing in the face of broader economic pressures.
The May surge follows Apple's strategic push to diversify its supply chainshifting more assembly to India and Vietnam to mitigate tariff risksand aggressive promotions in mature and emerging markets.
With the iPhone 15 lineup mid-cycle and iOS 18 beta testing underway, Apple is betting that software upgrades and services bundling can reinforce hardware appeal.
Why It Matters: Dominating Chinaa market that accounts for roughly 20% of Apple's revenuesignals healthy demand for high-end smartphones and could bolster Apple's overall growth outlook amid macro headwinds.

Aggressive price cuts helped lift Apple's sales in China. The company reduced prices on its iPhone 16 lineup by up to 2,530 yuan (about $351), in a bid to compete with local players such as Huawei. Analysts note the discounts helped restore momentum but may not be a sustainable strategy over the longer term.
Data from China's telecom regulator also showed a slight rise in foreign-brand smartphone shipments in April, signaling steady consumer interest despite rising competition.
Counterpoint's Ivan Lam said iPhone shipments for the second quarter appear promising, although future performance may hinge on sustained demand in Apple's two largest markets.
Based on the one year price targets offered by 41 analysts, the average target price for Apple Inc is $231.02 with a high estimate of $300.00 and a low estimate of $141.00. The average target implies a upside of +15.97% from the current price of $199.20.
Based on GuruFocus estimates, the estimated GF Value for Apple Inc in one year is $209.54, suggesting a upside of +5.19% from the current price of $199.20.

Buffett and his late right-hand man Charlie Munger have long believed in putting most of Berkshire's capital to work in their top ideas.
Seven magnificent stocks account for more than $203 billion of Berkshire Hathaway's $283 billion investment portfolio.
10 stocks we like better than Apple ›
There's probably not a money manager on Wall Street who garners as much attention asBerkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B)CEO Warren Buffett. The appropriately named ""Oracle of Omaha"" has overseen a nearly 6,000,000% aggregate return in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A) through the closing bell on June 9. For the sake of comparison, the broad-basedS&P 500's total return, including dividends, is a shade over 40,000% over the same 60-year timeline.
Despite Buffett being 94 years old andplanning to step down as CEO by the end of the year, investors still eagerly follow his investing activity. Riding Buffett's coattails and mirroring his trading activity has been a profitable venture for decades.
But one of the most defining aspects of Warren Buffett's investment philosophy has been his penchant for portfolio concentration. Both Buffett and late right-hand man Charlie Munger believed in putting an outsized percentage of their company's invested assets to work in their best ideas.
With less than seven months to go before Buffett officially cedes his long-held executive role to Greg Abel, he's wagering 72% ($203.3 billion) of Berkshire Hathaway's $283 billion of invested assets on just seven unstoppable stocks.
Despite Buffett paring down 67% of Berkshire's stake inApple(NASDAQ: AAPL)since Sept. 30, 2023, it still represents the Oracle of Omaha's largest holding by asubstantialamount.
While Apple's calling card has often been its innovation, as well as its ongoing transformation into a higher-margin subscription-driven operating model, Buffett's investment in Apple primarily revolves around his keen understanding of consumer behaviors. Apple has an exceptionally loyal customer base, and most importantly consumers trust the brand.
Additionally, Apple has the world's leading share-repurchase program. Since kicking off its buyback initiative in 2013, Apple has spent more than $750 billion to reduce its outstanding share count by 43.3%. Lowering its share count has undoubtedly had a positive impact on the company's earnings per share.",neutral,0

Creator of the iPhone and App Store, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a legendary developer of consumer electronics and software.
Why Could AAPL Be a Winner?
Apple's revenue base is so large because nearly everyone in the U.S. has an iPhone, but this is a double-edged sword. Growth must now come from upgrades, a harder pitch that has resulted in sluggish top-line performance recently.
Still, Apple's devices have endured for decades, speaking to its brand, design ethos, and technological chops. Its success is rare in the world of consumer electronics, which is fraught because of commoditization, competition, and obsolescence risk.
The company may not have the best gross margin because of its hardware orientation, but it still manages to produce elite operating and free cash flow margins. This shows it doesn’t need over-the-top marketing campaigns to convince people to buy its products.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the15 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Street.On June 10, Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani reiterated an “Outperform” rating and $250.00 price target on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).
Highlighting the recent keynote, analysts stated how it matched expectations of a transition year and that there were minimal announcements. One of the main announcements was Apple’s decision to allow developers access to its foundational AI models, which power Apple Intelligence. This permission will integrate AI features into apps that can operate independently of internet connectivity.
To conclude, all the announcements were largely in line with analyst predictions before the event. This is why the keynote likely did not revise perceptions of Apple’s stock value.
Here are his comments:
“The keynote was largely consistent with our preview that this would be a ‘transition year’ with relatively minor announcements. As expected, the biggest AI related announcement was Apple is opening up its on-device foundational AI models that underpin Apple Intelligence. This will enable developers to build AI features into their apps with 100% of the processing taking place on device, therefore working with or without an internet connections. The other AI announcements include deeper Visual Intelligence integration and live translate which will come to a variety of apps including messages, phone, and Facetime. It will also be available to developers via API. Apple also announced a new ‘Liquid Glass’ technology and changed the nomenclature used for its various operating systems. In addition to the ‘Liquid Glass’ changes to iOS, Apple also announced some visual changes for iOS 26, inspired by VisionOS. iPad OS will get some notable updates including some new multitasking features that will further blur the lines between MacOS and iPadOS. Apple Watch is getting a new ‘Workout Buddy’ that will offer enhanced fitness features and increases the devices lead as one of the best pieces of fitness hardware. Net/net: The announcements were consistent with our expectations heading into the event. Unlikely anything at the event changed anyone’s view on the stock.”
Apple is a technology company known for its consumer electronics, particularly the iPhones and MacBooks.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -Nearly all the iPhones exported by Foxconn from India went to the United States between March and May, customs data showed, far above the 2024 average of 50% and a clear sign ofApple's efforts to bypass high U.S.tariffsimposed on China.
The numbers, being reported by Reuters for the first time, show Apple has realigned its India exports to almost exclusively serve the U.S. market, when previously the devices were more widely distributed to countries including the Netherlands, the Czech Republic and Britain.
During March-May, Foxconn exported iPhones worth $3.2 billion from India, with an average 97% shipped to the United States, compared to a 2024 average of 50.3%, according to commercially available customs data seen by Reuters.
India iPhone shipments by Foxconn to the United States in May 2025 were worth nearly $1 billion, the second-highest ever after the record $1.3 billion worth of devices shipped in March, the data showed.
Apple declined to comment, while Foxconn did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.
U.S.President Donald Trumpon Wednesday said China will face 55% tariffs after the two countries agreed on a plan, subject to both leaders' approval, to ease levies that had reached triple digits.
India is subject, like most U.S trading partners, to a baseline 10% tariff and is trying to negotiate an agreement to avert a 26% ""reciprocal"" levy that Trump announced and then paused in April.
Apple's increased production in India drew a strong rebuke from Trump in May. ""We are not interested in you building in India, India can take care of themselves, they are doing very well, we want you to build here,"" Trump recalled telling CEO Tim Cook.
In the first five months of this year, Foxconn has already sent iPhones worth $4.4 billion to the U.S. from India, compared to $3.7 billion in the whole of 2024.
Apple has been taking steps to speed up production from India to bypass tariffs, which would make phones shipped from China to the U.S. much more expensive. In March, it chartered planes to transport iPhone 13, 14, 16 and 16e models worth roughly $2 billion to the United States.
Apple has also lobbied Indian airport authorities to cut the time needed to clear customs at Chennai airport in the southern state of Tamil Nadu from 30 hours to six hours, Reuters has reported. The airport is a key hub for iPhone exports.

Apple(AAPL)has been in full focus since it disappointed both fans and investors at the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC).
Tech developers and Apple enthusiasts alike typically look forward to this event every year, as it often includes the unveiling of new products or innovations. But this year, the highly anticipated event resulted in AAPL stock falling hard as investors reacted negatively to a disappointing update regarding one of Apple’s flagship products.

When Apple software chief Craig Federighi took the stage at WWDC, he discussed the progress the company has made with Apple Intelligence, its artificial intelligence (AI) platform. But as he moved on to providing an update on Apple’s virtual assistant Siri, things quickly took a turn for the worse, as he revealed that its AI revamp isn’t coming yet.
This news disappointed both Apple investors and consumers, resulting in harsh criticism from multiple financial experts.
The past month has brought numerous complications for Apple, primarily from Capitol Hill. President Donald Trump hasmade it clearthat he doesn’t want the company to build iPhones in India, despite CEO Tim Cook’s plans to invest $500 billion in manufacturing in the U.S. over the coming years.

Trump seems intent on strong-arming Apple into building its flagship product on U.S. soil, no matter how many experts argue that it isn’t possible, due to economic factors and a lack of labor. This list includes Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives, a noted tech expert whodescribesTrump’s vision as a “fairy tale” with almost no chance of happening.
Since the underwhelming WWDC, though, many people have sounded off, expressing their disappointment in the company’s execution and failure to innovate. Apple’s slow approach to AI isn’t news, but now it may be causing investors to lose confidence in the consumer tech leader.
A well-known AAPL stock bull, Ives noted that the event revealed “slow and steady improvements"" but still described it as “overall a yawner,” highlighting the popular consensus that its lack of exciting updates is working against the company.

TSMC produces the chips that drive everything from Nvidia’s GPUs to Apple’s iPhones, and it’s now experiencing accelerated growth fueled by surging AI demand, global factory expansion, and massive capital investment. Despite its strong rebound and concerns about exuberant valuations, TSMC still appears attractively priced. Given how sharply TSM has bounced back, the stock could become the ultimate Tech play, with its best days still ahead.
Many tech giants are currently riding the AI wave, but when it comes to TSMC, it’s more appropriate to say that the company is steering it. As the world’s largest contract chipmaker, it produces the advanced processors that Nvidia, AMD (AMD), and Apple (AAPL) rely on to bring AI to life. InTSMC’s latest earnings call in April, CEO C.C. Wei revealed that AI chip revenue, which tripled in 2024, is expected to double again this year.
This is currently a major tailwind for TSMC, driving a 41.6% year-over-year revenue surge. Specifically, advanced 3nm and 5nm chips, critical for AI’s heavy lifting, made up 73% of wafer sales. With cloud giants like Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) building AI data centers at breakneck speed, the company’s factories are running at full capacity, with no signs that demand is slowing down anytime soon.
In the meantime, with AI entering the sphere of national security, TSMC has been incentivized to not keep its magic in Taiwan. It’s spreading its wings to secure its AI dominance and sidestep geopolitical risks. The company is investing $165 billion in U.S. factories, with Arizona’s first fab already fully booked by heavyweights like Nvidia and Qualcomm (QCOM). Here’s how all these giants stack up on TipRanks’ stock comparison tool:
Moreover, in Europe, a new $10 billion plant in Dresden, Germany, and a chip design center in Munich are positioning TSMC to capture the continent’s growing AI market. Beyond the motive of diversifying supply chain and hedging geopolitical risk, TSMC has managed to secure long-term, high-value contracts with global tech titans through these moves, as they, in turn, can make such commitments with notably less risk involved.",positive,1

The company’s Siri team is aiming to bring the revamped voice assistant to market as part of an iOS 26.4 software update, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The long-promised changes will allow Siri to tap into consumers’ personal data and on-screen activities in order to better fulfill queries.
Apple’s “.4” updates — known as “E” on the company’s internal software development schedule — are typically released in March. That was the case with iOS 18.4 this year and iOS 17.4 in 2024. But an exact date hasn’t been set internally for the software, beyond a spring time frame, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the work is private.
Apple, in response to a request for comment, said it hasn’t announced exact timing for the new Siri features. It reiterated earlier statements that the upgrades are planned for the “coming year.”
The timeline could still shift depending on whether new snags emerge. If the next several weeks of development work proves promising, the company could consider giving a preview of the features when it launches the next iPhones in the fall, one of the people said, though no final decisions have been made.
The upgrade has been a long time coming. Apple originally introduced the next-generation Siri features at its Worldwide Developers Conference in June of last year. The idea was to modernize the voice assistant — first introduced in 2011 — which hasn’t kept pace with chatbots and other AI tools.
The technology in the works also includes a system called App Intents that allows Siri to more precisely control applications and in-app actions across Apple devices.
If the latest release timing sticks, Apple will have gone nearly two years between announcing the new Siri and delivering it to customers. It’s been an especially high-profile delay because the capabilities were part of the iPhone 16 marketing last year — despite the new Siri not being close to ready.
Internally, Apple’s AI and marketing teams have pointed fingers at each other.

The saying goes, “What is good for the goose is good for the gander.” Could this also apply to investment strategies?
In recent years, several firms have turned to Bitcoin as a means to increase shareholder value after feeling they had reached a plateau. While experts debate the risk, so far, the ploy has worked for MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) and Metaplanet. Both companies’ stocks have surged as much as 4,000% and 2,000%, respectively, since they started adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets.

So why not Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)? That is the proposition MicroStrategy Chair Michael Saylor has recently made.
“Apple should buy Bitcoin,” SaylorsaidTuesday on X.
Saylor's post was in response toremarksby CNBC host Jim Cramer.
“The Apple [stock] buyback is not working right now,” Cramer said. “The company can leave it to earn a lot, or it can take some and integrate. It is not a badge of dishonor. It just isn’t.”
Firms typically engage in stock buybacks as a way of signaling confidence in their business and returning value to shareholders.
Appleannounceda $100 billion buyback at the start of May after reporting fiscal second-quarter revenue and earnings surpassing analysts’ expectations. Typically, these types of announcements are followed by a surge in share price. But as highlighted by Cramer, this has not been the case.

At last look, Apple’s stock price is down over 3% since announcing the buyback and down 19% year-to-date. There are several reasons for this. For one, Apple CEO Tim Cook said at the time that the company had taken a $900 million cost hit due toPresident Donald Trump’s tariff policies. At the same time, the announced $100 billion buyback represented a $10 billion reduction from the previous year, indicating that the company wants to retain more cash amid uncertain economic conditions.
Unlike Apple’s stock, Bitcoin is up 16% since May and year-to-date. Meanwhile, MicroStrategy’s stock price has been unchanged since May but up 31% year-to-date.
Still, It is unclear whether Apple will be swayed by Saylor’s proposition. In 2021, Cookadmitted to owning cryptocurrenciessuch as Bitcoin and Ethereum, stating that holding the assets made sense as part of a diversified portfolio. But he maintained that it was not something Apple was considering.",neutral,0

Nevertheless, Apple still attempted to appease the crowd with a few AI-related announcements, such as an image analysis tool, a workout coach, a live translation feature, and more.
Visual Intelligence is Apple’s AI-powered image analysis technology that allows you to gather information about your surroundings. For example, it can identify a plant in a garden, tell you about a restaurant, or recognize a jacket someone is wearing.
Now, the feature will be able to interact with the information on your iPhone’s screen. For instance, if you come across a post on a social media app, Visual Intelligence can conduct an image search related to what you see while browsing. The tool performs the search using Google Search, ChatGPT, and similar apps.
To access Visual Intelligence, open the Control Center or customize the Action button (the same button typically used to take a screenshot). The feature becomes available with iOS 26 when it launches later this year.Read more.
Apple integratedChatGPT into Image Playground, its AI-powered image generation tool. With ChatGPT, the app can now generate images in new styles, such as “anime,” “oil painting,” and “watercolor.” There will also be an option to send a prompt to ChatGPT to let it create additional images.Read more.
Apple’s latest AI-driven workout coach is exactly what it sounds like — it uses a text-to-speech model to deliver encouragement while you exercise, mimicking a personal trainer’s voice. When you begin a run, the AI within the Workout app provides you with a motivational talk, highlighting key moments such as when you ran your fastest mile and your average heart rate. After you’ve completed the workout, the AI summarizes your average pace, heart rate, and whether you achieved any milestones.Read more.
Apple Intelligence is powering a new live translation feature for Messages, FaceTime, and phone calls. This technology automatically translates text or spoken words into the user’s preferred language in real time. During FaceTime calls, users will see live captions, whereas for phone calls, Apple will translate the conversation aloud.Read more.

Apple fixes new iPhone zero-day bug used in Paragon spyware hacks,The iPhone maker quietly updated a February security advisory to publicize a flaw that was used to hack at least two journalists in Europe.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-fixes-iphone-zero-day-170641824.html,,AAPL,[],2025-06-12 17:06:41+00:00,,,"Researchers revealed on Thursday thattwo European journalists had their iPhones hacked with spyware made by Paragon. Apple says it has fixed the bug that was used to hack their phones.
The Citizen Lab wrote in its report, shared with TechCrunch ahead of its publication, that Apple had told its researchers that the flaw exploited in the attacks had been “mitigated in iOS 18.3.1,” a software update for iPhones released on February 10.
Until this week, the advisory of that security updatementionedonly one unrelated flaw, whichallowed attackers to disable an iPhone security mechanismthat makes it harder to unlock phones.
On Thursday, however, Appleupdated its February 10 advisoryto include details about a new flaw, which was also fixed at the time but not publicized.
“A logic issue existed when processing a maliciously crafted photo or video shared via an iCloud Link. Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals,” reads the now-updated advisory.
In the final version of its report published Thursday, The Citizen Lab confirmed this is the flaw used against Italian journalist Ciro Pellegrino and an unnamed “prominent” European journalist.

It’s unclear why Apple did not disclose the existence of this patched flaw until four months after the release of the iOS update, and an Apple spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment seeking clarity.
The Paragon spyware scandal began in January, when WhatsApp notified around 90 of its users,including journalists and human rights activists, that they had been targeted with spyware made by Paragon, dubbed Graphite.
Then, at the end of April,several iPhone users received a notificationfrom Apple alerting them that they had been the targets of mercenary spyware. The alert did not mention the spyware company behind the hacking campaign.
On Thursday, The Citizen Labpublished its findingsconfirming that two journalists who had received that Apple notification were hacked with Paragon’s spyware.
It’s unclear if all the Apple users who received the notification were also targeted with Graphite. The Apple alert said that “today’s notification is being sent to affected users in 100 countries.”",neutral,0

Apple said at its WWDC developer conference Monday that the much-hyped Apple Intelligence features it announced at last year’s event are still not ready to ship—and likely won’t be until 2026. Now, the company is living with a media narrative that it’sfailed,fallen behind,stuck in neutral, orin retreaton AI.
To be clear, Apple’s various operating systems already include AI-powered features, from photo cleanup to call screening. And the company did deliver some of the Apple Intelligence tools it promised last year. But those were first-generation large language model functions like text message summarization and writing assistance—unambitious by generative AI standards and not especially useful.
What got everyone excited at WWDC 2024 were the advanced, personalized AI features that allow Siri to leverage a user’s personal data and carry out actions on their behalf. Some examples:
A user could say, “Hey Siri, when does Mom’s flight land?” and Siri—having access to the user’s email, contacts, calendar, and files—would know the answer.
Siri would also be able to “see” what’s on the user’s screen, so it could, for example, read an address from a text message and add it to a contact card.
A user could tell Siri to take action within an app, such as: “Siri, take the red-eye out of this photo,” or “Send the email I drafted to Judy and Carmen.”
Cool stuff, useful, and things Apple is uniquely positioned to offer. So what happened?
Apple software chief Craig Federighi and head of marketing Greg “Joz” Joswiak offered a fuller explanation during a round of media interviews Tuesday. According to them, Apple had a working “version one” of a new Siri architecture before announcing the personal AI features at WWDC 2024. (In other words: No, the demos weren’t vaporware.) The Siri team believed they could continue polishing the product until it performed reliably enough for a late 2024 release.
But Federighi explained in aninterview withTechRadarthat the system continued to generate too many unreliable results in internal testing. When a year-end release became unrealistic, the team aimed for spring 2025. But by then, the system was still inconsistent. That’s when the Siri team concluded it would need to create a “version two” of the new Siri architecture—one that “extends across the entire Siri experience.” Until that reworked Siri is performing reliably in-house, Federighi said, the company won’t speculate on a public release date.",neutral,0
Your iPad is your new computer,"Apple's upcoming iPadOS 26 makes the iPad function more like a MacBook, rather than a giant iPhone, making it a boon for productivity.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ipad-computer-153707214.html,,AAPL,[],2025-06-12 15:37:07+00:00,,,"After itsWWDC 2025event, Apple described its upcomingiPadOS 26update as “the biggest iPadOS release ever.” This doesn’t seem like it’s just a self-aggrandizing exaggeration — iPadOS 26 could actually change the way we think about the utility of a 15-year-old product that has long felt like an oversized iPhone designed for a cyclops.
The new OS brings us multi-tasking tools, a new windowing system, and the Preview app, which may not sound as alluring as “Liquid Glass.” But if you’ve ever tried to have a productive workday via iPad, then this news is more exciting than Sabrina Carpenter’snew albumannouncement (and that’s not just because her new song waskinda mid).
As it stands now, you can only havetwo windows open at onceon the iPad, and navigating between the two windows is kind of a nightmare. If you’re trying to write an email while also looking at your calendar to confirm that you’re giving your co-worker a good time to call you, then you’ll probably be toggling the two windows back and forth, struggling to see all of the relevant information. It’s kind of a mess, and a big reason why I never work on my iPad (despite having spent over $100 on Logitech’s detachable keyboard…)
If I have to refer to any sources during the writing process — whether that be a press release, interview notes, an email, a research paper, or, god forbid, all of the above — then I might as well just pull my phone out as a second tiny screen. Let’s just say, it isn’t the most user-friendly experience.
With the new window controls in iPadOS 26, you can see all of your open windows at once, then tile them intuitively to help you multitask. These window controls are also compatible withStage Manager, which lets you organize your windows into specific environments. As a result, iPadOS isremoving its older multitasking features,Split View and Slide Over.
Meanwhile, the iPad’s new Preview app makes it possible to edit and view PDFs natively, including features like AutoFill and Apple Pencil compatibility.
Like Mac products, iPad apps will now get a menu bar, which makes it easier to locate specific commands or features within an app. Developers also have access to customizing the menu bar in their own apps.
And if you often work with folders, you can pin them to your dock, rather than navigating through a clunky Files app.
There’s more to the new OS than these quality-of-life features (which, frankly, could’ve been shipped a while ago). Given the computing power of Apple’s silicon chips, iPadOS 26 can perform high-intensity background tasks like exporting a video, allowing you to keep working while waiting for the export to complete.",neutral,0

Let's talk a little bit more about the tech trade. Nvidia trading near record highs as tech per usual big driver of the market's push higher. The tech sector, is it poised to remain the market leader? That's the big question. Our very own Josh Schafer joins us now at the desk. You've been digging into this and this leadership that we've seen from tech in this rally.
Yeah, Brad, so I mean, you have the S&P 500 back near record highs, of course, Nvidia also back near record highs, as you mentioned, right? And so the question I've sort of been posing the strategist over the last week is, okay, well, if we go higher, what takes us higher, right? What's sort of this next leg of the bull market? And I think it's interesting because you sort of hear both sides of this trade, right? Like the folks over at City, they just moved up their S&P 500 target to 6300. They're still talking about growth is defensive. You think about a lot of these companies, Nvidia would probably be included in that, maybe an Apple, all really all of them, right? Are cash rich businesses, they're businesses that can do well if rates stay higher. But what I thought was interesting, different take from Richard Bernstein over at Richard Bernstein Advisors. He had a note out calling it the mid seven.
Mhm.
And so when I talked to Richard, he highlighted this chart. Uh this is the percent of stocks that have outperformed the S&P 500. Of course, those two little lines you see over the last two years are 2023 and 2024, right? That was your mag seven led rally. Well, pick your head up. Stocks outside of the mag seven have been doing very well thus far in 2025, right? You've seen a lot of outperformance from a lot of the other sectors. I think seven of the 11 S&P 500 sectors are outperforming the index. And so Bernstein sort of making the point that as growth slows for that mag seven cohort. Yes, the earnings year of year growth is still strong, but it is slowing, right? That rate of change is coming down. That might make the case for perhaps some more of the 493 and some other areas of the market to be areas where you can you can play.
I I just didn't expect from mid seven the Gen Z vernacular to make its way into a Richard Bernstein analysis here. It's mid right now.
It's mid. Sometimes it's just mid, Brad.
You know, as we talk about that leadership, Adil, what are you anticipating from the mag seven, especially as we're looking for this diversification within portfolios right now?
Yeah, so we we do think that these companies will continue to do well because what happens is that there's a lot of expenditure that is going into artificial intelligence. There's a lot of government policy that is supporting artificial. There's deregulation also happening. And that makes us believe that because of the productivity that these companies are bringing about because of AI related productivity, that's going to cause GDP to increase as well. So we do think that the mag seven will continue to do well, but one of the problems we see, we deal with a lot of retail investors. One of the problems we see is that people are like overly concentrated in the mag seven. You know, like they'll have 60 to 70% of their portfolio in tech related investments. That's where we want to put the personal finance hat on, and we want to say that this can be treacherous. Make sure you're broad because to your point, there are a lot of other sectors that are doing really well. AI doesn't mean that only mag seven will do well. There are other sectors that could do well also.
Has that rebalancing started to happen among clients yet? Because I feel like April was maybe a wake up or February to April was a little bit of a wake up call, right? Those a lot of those stocks got hammered pretty significantly, but then you had the strong come up really over the last month and a half now. Are clients starting to really wonder like, okay, should I rebalance here? Did I just hold Nvidia? Did really well, and now it's too big in the portfolio?
Well, there's this is where the behavioral finance comes in as well because, you know, people don't want to sell Nvidia like they love it, right? So and we've been where others were being aggressive end of last year, we were being defensive. We were saying all right, you know, take a pause, take a step back, right size your exposure to these companies, increase the breadth of your portfolio. So we have been doing it, but I do feel that the ordinary retail investor that is having a do it yourself approach is overexposed there. Uh if you look at the S&P 500 by itself, that's more than 40% in tech right now. And if you add a few other technology companies in the portfolio, now you're 50, 60% in tech, right? That's the ordinary retail investor that has a do it yourself approach.",neutral,0

A more than two-fold gain in CoreWeave’s shares since the end of April has saddled short sellers with $1.6 billion in paper losses, according to data from S3 Partners. Undeterred by an eye-watering cost to borrow that’s hit about 150% of the stock price, there are plenty of traders willing to bet against CoreWeave, according to Ihor Dusaniwsky, S3’s managing director of predictive analytics.
“A lot of new guys think this new price level is an extraordinarily attractive short,” Dusaniwsky said. “Shorts are staying in because they believe the expected P&L more than offsets the financing costs.”
Borrow fees, which are annualized, are typically much lower for most other stocks. Tesla Inc. and Apple Inc., for example, both have borrow fees of less than 1%.
CoreWeave’s heavy spending and the run up in its shares have made the company a popular target for short sellers, who borrow a stock and sell it with the aim of buying it back at a lower price and pocketing the difference. The bears have gotten some relief from a two-day slump this week, but CoreWeave shares gained as much as 3.4% in early trading on Thursday after a report that the firm won new business from Google.
CoreWeave rents cloud computing capacity to customers like Microsoft Corp. and is expanding rapidly amid brisk demand for AI infrastructure. However, that growth requires a lot of investment, which prompted CoreWeave last month to forecast capital spending of as much as $23 billion in its current fiscal year. The company is projected to lose $934 million this year, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
Felix Wang, an analyst at Hedgeye Risk Management, recommended shorting CoreWeave in April and has watched in disbelief as the stock has pushed higher. Still, Wang is sticking with his call and remains skeptical that CoreWeave will be able to obtain larger, new multi-year contracts in the coming years.
“My belief is that there is no path forward on them reaching profitability in at least a few years and losses will continue to go higher and higher,” he said in an interview. “It’s hard, but I’m trying to screen out the noise and the meme volatility.”",neutral,0

The much-anticipated event showcased updates across Apple's operating systems, including a new design language called ""Liquid Glass,"" but left some analysts and investors underwhelmed by its advancements in artificial intelligence.
With the recent buzz around Apple, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends too. As of now, Apple offers an annual dividend yield of 0.52%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 26 cents per share ($1.04 a year).
To figure out how to earn $500 monthly from Apple, we start with the yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months).
Next, we take this amount and divide it by Apple $1.04 dividend: $6,000 / 1.04 = 5,769 shares.
So, an investor would need to own approximately $1,146,762 worth of Apple, or 5,769 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500.
Assuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 / $1.04 = 1,154 shares, or $229,392 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100.
View more earnings on AAPL
Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.
The dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change.
For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its current price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60).
Conversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40).
Further, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same. Similarly, if a company decreases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will decrease.
AAPL Price Action:Shares of Apple fell by 1.9% to close at $198.78 on Wednesday.

Researchers confirm two journalists were hacked with Paragon spyware,"The confirmation of two hacked victims further deepens an ongoing spyware scandal that, for now, appears largely focused on the Italian government.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/researchers-confirm-two-journalists-were-120000196.html,,AAPL,[],2025-06-12 12:00:00+00:00,,,"Two European journalists were hacked usinggovernment spywaremade by Israeli surveillance tech provider Paragon, new research has confirmed.
On Thursday, digital rights groupThe Citizen Labpublished a new report detailing the results of a new forensic investigation into the iPhones of Italian journalist Ciro Pellegrino and an unnamed “prominent” European journalist. The researchers said both journalists were hacked by the sameParagoncustomer, based on evidence found on the two journalists’ devices.
Until now, there was no evidence that Pellegrino, who works foronline news website Fanpage, had been either targeted or hacked with Paragon spyware.When he was alerted by Apple at the end of April, the notification referred to a mercenary spyware attack, but did not specifically mention Paragon, nor whether his phone had been infected with the spyware.
The confirmation of the first-ever known Paragon infections further deepens an ongoing spyware scandal that, for now, appears to be mostly focused on the use of spyware by the Italian government, but could expand to include other countries in Europe.
These new revelations come months afterWhatsApp first notified around 90 of its usersin over two dozen countries in Europe and beyond, including journalists, that they had been targeted with Paragon spyware, known as Graphite. Among those targeted were several Italians,including Pellegrino’s colleague and Fanpage director Francesco Cancellato, as well as nonprofit workers who help rescue migrants at sea.
Last week, Italy’s parliamentary committee known as COPASIR, which oversees the country’s intelligence agencies’ activities,published a report that said it found no evidence that Cancellato was spied on. The report, which confirmed that Italy’s internal and external intelligence agencies AISI and AISE were Paragon customers, made no mention of Pellegrino.
The Citizen Lab’s new report puts into question COPASIR’s conclusions.
“A week ago it seemed like Italy was putting this scandal to bed. Now they’ll have to reckon with new forensic evidence,” John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at The Citizen Lab, told TechCrunch ahead of the report’s publication. “Ciro’s case adds to the big and politically tricky question: Who has been hacking Italian journalists with Paragon spyware? This mystery needs an answer.”
Scott-Railton said The Citizen Lab believes that the Italian government is in a position to definitively answer questions about what was done with their use of Paragon spyware, particularly regarding Ciro’s case.",neutral,0

Do World’s Fairs Still Matter?
Shortly after two days of negotiations wrapped, Trump declared Wednesday on social media that a deal had been “DONE” to restore the flow of critical magnets from China, and pledged to lift curbs on student visas. Hours earlier, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick revealed Washington would unwind its recent tech curbs, if niche metals essential to US auto and defense firms now flowed fast enough.
China’s focus was very different. A People’s Daily commentary on Thursday — Beijing’s most substantial comments so far on the talks — made no mention of export controls. Instead, the Communist Party mouthpiece touted an “institutional guarantee” established in Geneva for the two sides to bridge differences via a “consultation mechanism.” In a long-awaited leaders’ call before the London negotiations, Xi told Trump the importance of using this channel, it added.
The contrast illustrates a disconnect in how the world’s biggest economies want to manage their trade dispute, and broader rollercoaster relationship. While Trump seeks quick deals done directly with top leaders, Xi favors a framework led by his lieutenants that wards against being blindsided. Such haggling could drag on for years, with the “Phase One” deal from the first trade war taking most of Trump’s first term.
“Xi is playing a longer game on US-China trade. His time in office is simply much longer than Trump’s,” said Christopher Beddor, deputy China research director at Gavekal Research. “That’s not to say there’s never any short-term thinking, but the lack of term limits presents very different incentives than for Trump.”
While slow-walking negotiations allows China the chance to assess how hard a bargain Trump drives with other nations, the lingering uncertainty is bad for business, he added.
Xi showed last week he can be flexible, getting on the phone with Trump as ties spiraled, breaking from the protocol to set up such an interaction. In the Biden era, then National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and Foreign Minister Wang Yi would huddle in foreign locations for days before their leaders spoke directly, managing outcomes and expectations.",neutral,0
Prediction: 3 Stocks Berkshire Hathaway Will Add to Its Portfolio After Warren Buffett Steps Down as CEO,"Berkshire could have multiple new holdings as Abel may want to put his stamp on the company.

Berkshire could have multiple new holdings as Abel may want to put his stamp on the company.
There are some solid blue-chip stocks that aren't in Berkshire's portfolio that arguably should be in there already.
10 stocks we like better than Microsoft ›
Next year,Berkshire Hathawaywill have a new CEO. Warren Buffett, who has been in charge for decades, is stepping down and Greg Abel will be taking over. It's a monumental shift for the business, and while there may not necessarily be drastic changes in the day-to-day operations, there could be some adjustments to Berkshire's holdings.
There are three stocks that I think Abel should consider adding to Berkshire's portfolio once he takes over:Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT),Enbridge(NYSE: ENB), andNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Here's why these stocks are great long-term investments and why they fit the Berkshire mold.
Buffett distanced himself from Microsoftbecause of his close association with co-founder Bill Gates. But with Buffett no longer at the helm, it opens the path for Berkshire to create a position in Microsoft under Abel.
Microsoft is the type of business that checks all the boxes for Berkshire. It has solid fundamentals, many growth opportunities, and a strong brand that is known all over the world, giving it a fantasticcompetitive moat.
In the trailing 12 months, the software company generated more than $270 billion in revenue, amassing nearly $97 billion in profit along the way. Microsoft is a leading company in artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing, and its office software is a staple in many businesses around the world. This is an excellent stock for investors to own for the long haul, and I think it may just be a matter of time before it finds its way into Berkshire's holdings.
With Abel being from Canada and having strong roots in Alberta, I think he'll be inclined to put his stamp on Berkshire. And what better way to do so than by opening up a position in a top oil and gas company from Canada -- Enbridge. Berkshire is no stranger to the sector and holds multiple stocks from there.
Enbridge is known for its consistency and long-term dependability, which is why it also looks like a model Berkshire-type investment. This year, the company expects to meet or exceed its financial guidance, and if it does, it'll be the 20th consecutive year that Enbridge has done so. Few companies can generate that kind of consistency. And Buffett has always valued predictability and stability in businesses.",positive,1

Do you know about Asch conformity experiments?
Solomon Asch performed them in the 1950s. He invited individuals into the lab and asked them to judge the length of a line. He also placed 6 actors in the same room who were assigned to give the wrong answers so that the ignorant subject could hear them before he provided his own answer.
On average, 35% of the subjects followed the opinions of the actors even if their answer was obviously wrong. That is horrifying. What is even worse is that the study has been replicated numerous times.
Now, imagine a scenario in which the actors are given money immediately after giving the wrong answer, and the subject can see that too. What would be the percentage of subjects that gave the wrong answer then?

That study hasn't been done, but I think we are witnessing something similar unfolding in the tech space.
Marketing is everything.
If artificial intelligence were called ""pattern matching and transformation,"" it would not sound so cool, would it?
Alas, there is precisely zero intelligence in AI. It is just pattern matching and transformation. This is why it hallucinates so much. The farther away from its training data the query you give to the AI is, the crazier the reply you'll get.
Public companies don't do marketing just for consumers; they also need to attract investors. And when everyone around you starts hyping AI to attract investors, you may find yourself in a dilemma - is it OK to promise something you probably can't deliver?
Apple(AAPL)seems stuck in this dilemma but also faces significant pressures outside AI.
President Trump's threat of a 25% tariff on iPhones not manufactured in the U.S. put Apple under pressure. The companyexpectstariffs to add $900 million to its costs for the current quarter.
I've already written why large language models can't becomesentient. But Apple can't afford to say that. They carefully dance around it by occasionally releasing a research paper on AI's limitations, but that usually looks like a jab at the competition.
The company's management probably feels like a person in Asch's experiment, except that the actors are the competitors. Rivals promise stuff from science fiction, but that is still attracting investors.
Chaos created by unrealistic marketing is real.

Do World’s Fairs Still Matter?
The South Korean tech leader is making a $10 million investment in Skild, which develops software for robots, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The Santa Clara, California chipmaker is putting in $25 million, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing unannounced plans.
The financing is part of the company’s Series B funding round, which will value the company at around $4.5 billion and is led by a $100 million investment from Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp. (9984.T,SFTBY)
Internally, Samsung views its Skild investment as a way to keep visibility into the startup and its talent without needing to make a significant commitment. Another reason: to keep pace with other South Korean conglomerates like LG, Hanwha and Mirae Asset, which all have divisions putting between $5 million to $10 million into Skild.
Nvidia has begun to push the idea of “physical AI” — meaning robots and autonomous vehicles — becoming a significant future revenue driver as the technology matures. The chipmaker has semiconductors, software and services aimed at speeding up the deployment of robots that can think for themselves.
Samsung considers some aspects of Skild’s solutions inferior to others in the market, said some of the people. Representatives for Samsung and Nvidia declined to comment. A representative for Skild didn’t respond to an inquiry.
Robotics are quickly becoming a major area of future growth for the world’s technology companies, with Apple Inc (AAPL)., Meta Platforms Inc. (META), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and Alphabet Inc.’s (GOOG,GOOGL) Google all investing heavily in the space. Tesla Inc. (TSLA), meanwhile, has long been preparing to ship its Optimus robot.
A few months ago, Samsung took a minority stake in Physical Intelligence, which also develops underlying robotics algorithms, with a small investment. The startup has already raised around $400 million and was last valued at about $2.4 billion. Nvidia has invested in companies like Figure AI and Serve Robotics.

At its annual developer event, the company introduced a cautious update, unveiling refreshed operating systems and modest new AI tools, rather than making major announcements.
A wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.
CEO Tim Cook said Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) was looking to “harness the power of Apple Intelligence”, an AI-driven software update first introduced last year. Developers began testing the new features on June 9, with a broader rollout expected in the fall. These AI capabilities will only be available on newer iPhone models.
Analysts have been watching to see how Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) might monetize AI within its App Store, which earned over $30 billion in 2024, according to Bank of America. One potential route could involve paid AI features within apps, with Apple taking a share as it does with other digital purchases.
Among the updates are real-time AI translations of phone calls and messages processed directly on users’ devices, along with enhancements like letting the “Visual Search” tool interact with on-screen content.

Goldman Sachs reiterated the stock as “Buy” with a $253 price target. The tech giant hosted its annual developers’ conference on Monday, failing to introduce substantial artificial intelligence updates. Nevertheless, the firm said it’s sticking with the stock following its Worldwide Developers Conference reveal.
“AAPL traded down ~1% following the WWDC25 keynote (note: AAPL declined 2% last year after WWDC24), where the company announced design improvements and new features across its operating systems and first-party apps, but failed to demonstrate substantial progress in Apple Intelligence.”
The company has also confirmed that any enhancements to make Siri more personal are postponed till next year. This is very unlike last year’s conference, where Siri was a highlight and mentioned numerous times.
Despite these disappointments, analysts at Goldman Sachs believe that Apple is still a leader in consumer devices, with new features aimed at improving the user experience. These features include a new user interface named “Liquid Glass,” AI-driven capabilities, enhanced Visual Intelligence, and several quality-of-life features.
Looking ahead, the firm anticipates an upcoming improvement in the iPhone replacement cycle, which aligns with the introduction of new iPhone models in the years 2025, 2026, and 2027.
“We are Buy-rated on AAPL as we believe that the market’s focus on slower product revenue growth masks the strength of the Apple ecosystem and associated revenue durability & visibility.”

‘Classic Apple': Why Apple is taking the slow road with AI,"Apple is slow-rolling its AI rollout. Whether by design or necessity, it perfectly fits the company's MO.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/classic-apple-why-apple-is-taking-the-slow-road-with-ai-190306633.html,,AAPL,"['MSFT', 'GOOG']",2025-06-11 19:03:07+00:00,,,"Apple (AAPL) hosted itsannual WWDC eventat its Cupertino, Calif., headquarters on Monday, showing off a variety of improvements across its software offerings, including completelyoverhauled versions of the operating systemsthat power its devices.
It was a jam-packed show, but one thing Apple didn't provide was abig, splashy AI announcementlike its Big Tech peers Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOG,GOOGL) showed at their respective developer conferences last month.
Wall Street is keen on seeing Apple prove it has what it takes to compete in the AI race, and a showstopping debut, like its highly anticipated generative AI-powered Siri, could have done just that. Instead, Apple said it is opening up its AI software to its army of developers and served up a number of smaller AI features that augment existing apps and platforms with new, helpful capabilities.
And though that might not be the huge blowout news some investors were hoping for, the company's slower, more focused approach to AI could prove to be its best weapon in the AI fight.
""Apple's AI strategy, as showcased, leans more towards systemic integration and developer empowerment rather than delivering groundbreaking consumer-facing AI functionalities that have captured market attention,"" IDC vice president Francisco Jeronimo wrote in a statement.
""While this carries the risk of competitors moving faster, it also delineates a potential pathway for Apple to offer differentiated value, likely centered on its traditional pillars of privacy and seamless integration. This is a classic Apple modus operandi,"" Jeronimo added.
Perhaps the most important AI announcement at WWDC was the news that Apple is opening up its on-device language models to third-party developers. While this might not sound all that interesting in and of itself, the move could pay significant dividends in the future.
Apple's decision to give its roughly 30 million developers access to its language models is ""somewhat akin to a modernized App Store moment,"" Morgan Stanley's Erik Woodring said.
When Apple launched its App Store in 2008, it kicked off a massive explosion in app development that upended everything from delivery and transportation services to e-commerce and social media. It also gave Apple a fresh revenue stream via commissions on in-app purchases.
Opening its AI models to developers could likewise help spur developers to create new software options that go well beyond what Apple could produce on its own, driving the development of apps and services that could eventually become household names.",neutral,0
"At WWDC, Apple says it will use AI to tag apps to improve discoverability on the App Store","Apple will begin using AI technology to power the discovery of apps on the App Store, the company announced at this week’s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC 25).

In a session focused on updates to App Store Connect, its app distribution platform for developers, the company announced it will introduce App Store Tags — labels that highlight specific features and functionalities found in an app.
These tags will initially be generated by Apple’s large language models using various sources, like the app’s metadata. They’ll then be human-reviewed before being applied to apps on the App Store.
Apple customers will be able to use these tags when searching for apps on the App Store, where the tags appear alongside the categories on the search page and the apps that appear in the search results.
Apple says the new tags will help surface information that’s often buried in app listings, like the app’s App Store description, category, metadata, or even in its screenshots. The tags, Apple believes, will help users more easily find the apps that offer the functionality they’re looking for, while also giving developers a better idea about how their apps are being discovered.
Today, consumers find apps through a number of App Store features, including its editorial pieces on the Today tab, collections curated by the App Store’s editorial team, by browsing app categories, or using App Store Search. Apple also monetizes the App Store with ads that can appear on the Today tab, the Search tab, on product pages, and in its search results.
When App Store users tap on one of the new tags, they’ll be taken to a new page offering a curated collection of all the apps and games that offer similar features or functionality — an extension to the App Store’s existing feature that points users to apps they “might also like,” found at the bottom of individual listings.
Although the tags themselves are AI-generated and reviewed, developers will ultimately have the final word on which tags are associated with their apps. A new information page will be available in the App Store Connect software, where they can manage tags or deselect those they don’t want to show up on their app’s product page.
Apple is already using AI on its App Store to summarize an app’s reviews by combining information into a short paragraph.
Tags aren’t the only improvements coming to the App Store. Apple says that developers will also be able to create custom product pages that appear when a user searches for apps using particular keywords. It’s also improving its app “nutrition labels” feature; expanding its lineup of app age ranges (there are now five); and extending offer codes to consumables, non-consumables, and non-renewing subscriptions.",neutral,0

So, what should investors do with Apple stock post the WWDC25 announcements? Let’s find out.
Apple stock has suffered from U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to levy tariffs on trade partners, including China, Mexico and Canada. China is an important market for Apple as the iPhone maker’s manufacturing is primarily concentrated in the country. Higher tariffs negatively impact Apple’s China supply chain. The Trump administration’s decision to exempt electronic devices like smartphones and computers from reciprocal tariffs provided some relief to Apple.Tariffs are currently expected to have a negative impact of roughly $900 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2025. Apple expects gross margin between 45.5% and 46.5% for the current quarter. In the fiscal second quarter, Apple reported a gross margin of 47.1%.Apple has been suffering from sluggish demand for the iPhone in China amid increasing competition from the likes of Huawei and Xiaomi, as well as the lack of Apple Intelligence. Greater China sales decreased 2.3% year over year in the second quarter of fiscal 2025.",neutral,0
WhatsApp fights Yvette Cooper’s ‘dangerous’ attempt to break encryption,Mark Zuckerberg’s WhatsApp has challenged a “dangerous” attempt by the Home Office to secretly force Apple to build a backdoor in its encryption technology.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/whatsapp-fights-yvette-cooper-dangerous-134755062.html,,AAPL,[],2025-06-11 15:55:06+00:00,,,"Mark Zuckerberg’s WhatsApp has challenged a “dangerous” attempt by the Home Office tosecretly force Apple to build a backdoorin its encryption technology.
The private messaging app said it had intervened in a case at theInvestigatory Powers Tribunal, submitting evidence criticising an order by Yvette Cooper’s department that requires Apple to break an “advanced data protection” feature that encrypts iPhone back-ups.
Will Cathcart, the head of Meta-owned WhatsApp, said: “Liberal democracies should want the best security for their citizens. Instead, the UK isdoing the oppositethrough a secret order.
“This case could set a dangerous precedent and embolden nations to try to break the encryption that protects people’s private communication.”
Apple ischallenging the “technical capability notice”from the Home Office, issued in January, that ordered it to secretly install a backdoor into the encryption feature it introduced in 2022.
The iPhone-maker was legally barred from confirming the existence of the order, which emerged in US media reports. Disclosing the existence of the demand is illegal under UK surveillance laws.
However, in February, Apple said it would bewithdrawing the feature in the UKand said it would “never build a backdoor or master key to any of our products or services and we never will”.
Ms Cooper’s order has prompted criticism from the White House and senior Republicans.
Donald Trump described the demand as “something that you hear about with China”.Tulsi Gabbard, the US national intelligence director, called it “egregious”.
WhatsApp said it would be arguing that the case should be heard in public.
Mr Cathcart said: “WhatsApp would challenge any law or government request that seeks to weaken the encryption of our services and will continue to stand up for people’s right to a private conversation online.”
In April, the Investigatory Powers Tribunal, a secret court that hears cases about intelligence matters, ruled against the Home Secretary’s push for the case to be heard in total secrecy. This would have meant that even the existence of the dispute could not be publicised.
The Home Office argued that any coverage of the matter could be “damaging to national security”. However, after an intervention by media groups, including The Telegraph, privacy advocates and a group of US politicians, Lord Justice Singh, the president of the tribunal, and Mr Justice Johnson dismissed the effort to keep even the “bare details” of the case private.
The court said it was possible that some of the future developments in the case could be made public.",neutral,0

RIP to the almost future of computing: Apple just turned the iPad into a Mac
But the company also spentthe first few minutesof its 90-minute keynote presentation focusing not on software, but on the new Brad Pitt filmF1: The Movie, which is being co-distributed by its film production arm, Apple Original Films.
And now Apple is further promoting the film with what is a first for the film industry: a haptic trailer.
The unique thing about Apple’s latestF1: The Movietrailer is that it literally vibrates as you watch it. Well, as long as you watch it on a compatible iPhone.
Apple calls this latest trailer a “haptic trailer.”
In the two-minute trailer, whenever an F1 car is in motion on the screen, your iPhone will vibrate with an intensity proportional to the on-screen action. So when a car’s tires are being changed in a pit stop, you’ll feel a small vibration in your hand—and when the car continues racing down the track, you’ll feel an even more intense vibration.
These vibration feedbacks in the gadget world are known as “haptics”—a technology that simulates physical touch. Apple can make your phone vibrate like this—and at certain points in the trailer, thanks to the iPhone’s Taptic Engine, a piece of hardware inside the iPhone that is essentially a motor that can vibrate on command.
Haptic feedback has been used for years in the iPhone. For example, when you press and hold an icon on the homescreen to rearrange its layout, you’ll feel haptic feedback produced by the Taptic Engine. You can feel haptic feedback in plenty of other places on the iPhone, such as when adjusting the volume or pressing a widget in Control Center.
But Apple’s application of haptic feedback to a movie trailer is the first time that the technology has been used to promote a film. Given the vibrations and forces an F1 car undergoes while racing down the track, a trailer forF1: The Movieis a natural fit for such technology.
To watch theF1: The Moviehaptic trailer, you’ll need an iPhone running the latest version of iOS 18. You can find the haptic trailer in the TV app on your iPhone by doing the following:",neutral,0

Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL)stock has taken a beating this year, with its shares down by 19% as of this writing. It might be tempting to attribute that performance to marketwide troubles, and that's partly true. However, even as theNasdaq Compositehas recovered from being in bear market territory some weeks ago -- and is now slightly in the green for the year -- Apple has trailed far behind.
The most immediate problem for the tech leader is President Trump's trade agenda, but there are others, including the fact that it trails other giants in the exciting artificial intelligence (AI) market. Despite these issues, there are compelling reasons to buy the stock. Here are three.
Apple is no longer the growth stock it once was, but it continues to generate steady revenue, profits, and cash flow. In the second quarter of its fiscal year 2025, Apple's revenue increased by 5% year over year to $95.4 billion, with earnings per share coming in at $1.65, up almost 8% compared to the year-ago period. Meanwhile, thetech giantgenerated $98.5 billion in free cash flow over the trailing-12-month period. Though that represents a 5% year-over-year decline, you'd be hard-pressed to find a single company worldwide with more cash to spare than Apple. Here's how it compares in that department with some of its similarly sized peers.
Investors will be familiar with the phrase ""cash is king."" One reason behind this sentiment is that having a boatload of cash allows companies the flexibility to invest in lucrative opportunities without having to sacrifice their obligations. One thing we know about Apple is that it has fostered a culture of innovation, and the cash it currently holds could be one of the keys to unlocking the next big thing for the tech leader.
It is working on various AI-related initiatives, including features it will add to its future smartphones. Apple may not make a breakthrough in the AI market immediately, but the company has a habit of improving existing technologies with great success. Having a substantial amount of cash on hand will enable the company to steer its AI strategy in whichever direction it chooses.
It will also help it mitigate tariff-related issues, perhaps by shifting production to some countries other than China -- Trump's favorite tariff target -- while also somewhat boosting its local manufacturing capacity.",positive,1

And then there was Monday morning’s WWDC 2025 keynote, as streamed online to millions and screened to a select audience of in-person attendees at Apple Park. After Apple’sembarrassing inability to ship the AI-infused update to Siriit showed off at WWDC 2024, it washardly surprisingthat this year’s event didn’t bet everything on whipping up a further AI frenzy. That alone set it apart from last month’sGoogle I/O keynote, whose topics consisted of AI, AI, and more AI, with some AI drizzled on top.
Appledidintroduce some new AI during the keynote—quite a bit of it. Overall, though, the event felt like an act of counterprogramming. Instead of positioning itself as a leader in AI—or at leastquashing fears that it’s a laggard—the company seemed happy being itself. From the unified new design to old features (phone calls!) turning up in new places (the Mac!), it focused on giving consumers even more reasons to own and use as many of its products as possible.
Herewith a few of the impressions I took away from my morning at Apple Park:
Liquid Glass is classic Apple, in the Steve Jobs sense.In 2012, one of Tim Cook’s first dramatic moves after succeeding Jobs as CEO was tooust software chief Scott Forstall. That led to a reorganization that put Jony Ive in charge of design for software as well as hardware. Ive’s influence was seen in the iPhone’s iOS 7 upgrade the company shipped the following year. It ditched the lushskeuomorphismof the iPhone’s software up until that time for a farflatterlook, bringing to mind the understated,Dieter Rams-like feel of an Ive MacBook, manifested in pixels rather than aluminum. Ive left in 2019, but the principles he instilled have informed Apple software ever since.
But now there’sLiquid Glass, a new aesthetic Apple is rolling out across its portfolio of platforms. It’s glossy, dimensional, pseudorealistic, and animated—a dramatic departure from iOS 7-era restraint, but reminiscent of both earlier iOS releases and also older Apple software all the way back to the first version of the Mac’s OS X in 2000. That was the one with buttons that Jobs said people would want tolick—a memorable design imperative that is suddenly relevant again.",neutral,0

Apple Intelligence (yes, also abbreviated to AI) showed up in Apple's ecosystem in October 2024, and it's here to stay as Apple competes with Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, and others to build the best AI tools.
Cupertino marketing executives have branded Apple Intelligence: “AI for the rest of us.” The platform is designed to leverage the things that generative AI already does well, like text and image generation, to improve upon existing features. Like other platforms includingChatGPTandGoogle Gemini, Apple Intelligence was trained on large information models. These systems use deep learning to form connections, whether it be text, images, video or music.
The text offering, powered by LLM, presents itself as Writing Tools. The feature is available across various Apple apps, including Mail, Messages, Pages and Notifications. It can be used to provide summaries of long text, proofread and even write messages for you, using content and tone prompts.
Image generation has been integrated as well, in similar fashion — albeit a bit less seamlessly. Users can prompt Apple Intelligence togenerate custom emojis (Genmojis)in an Apple house style. Image Playground, meanwhile, is astandalone image generation appthat utilizes prompts to create visual content that can be used in Messages, Keynote or shared via social media.
Apple Intelligence also marks a long-awaitedface-lift for Siri.The smart assistant was early to the game, but has mostly been neglected for the past several years. Siri is integrated much more deeply into Apple’s operating systems; for instance, instead of the familiar icon, users will see a glowing light around the edge of their iPhone screen when it’s doing its thing.
More importantly,new Siri works across apps. That means, for example, that you can ask Siri to edit a photo and then insert it directly into a text message. It’s a frictionless experience the assistant had previously lacked. Onscreen awareness means Siri uses the context of the content you’re currently engaged with to provide an appropriate answer.
Leading up toWWDC 2025, many expected that Apple would introduce us to an even more souped-up version of Siri, but we're going to have towait a bit longer.
“As we’ve shared, we’re continuing our work to deliver the features that make Siri even more personal,"" said Apple SVP of Software Engineering Craig Federighi at WWDC 2025. ""This work needed more time to reach our high-quality bar, and we look forward to sharing more about it in the coming year.”",neutral,0

All right, well, it is day two of Apple's worldwide developers conference is taking place. That's in California. And joining us now from that conference is Yahoo Finance tech editor Dan Howley. Dan.
Yeah, Josh, uh, this is, you know, day two, as you said, developers are still kind of milling around, analysts and journalists like myself are, are also here. And there's some takeaways that we're getting from the event yesterday now. And so one of those is kind of based on Apple's approach to AI and how that's been kind of a slow trickle from the huge explosion that we saw last year with Apple intelligence to what we saw this year where instead of a new big splashy announcement, they had smaller bits of AI that they're weaving throughout their operating system. It looks like that's going to be Apple's path forward, at least for now. And so we hear something about that new generative AI powered series that it's supposed to come at some point either this year or next year. We're still not entirely sure. That seems to be the way that Apple can compete and potentially win this AI race that they have against the likes of Google and Samsung. I think one of the things that gets conflated because of the idea that AI is so large is comparing Apple's approach to something like a Microsoft, which obviously provides the majority of its AI services to enterprises. And yes, they do have consumers, but if you look at, you know, the balance, it's going to be on the enterprise side. And so they obviously compete with Google as well as far as smartphones,
but really it comes down to the enterprise and what they can offer to advertising. So Apple's approach is going to be different naturally, but this way of kind of moving forward with the dribs and drabs, generally, it seems as though I, I got to see a few of these, these features that are truly helpful updates. So it's not that, you know, we're still seeing those, you know, make emojis or things like that, but then there's also ways of adding functionality to existing apps with AI that so far seems to be pretty, pretty helpful for users.
Dan, here, here's my big question for you as, as a reporter who has followed Apple for a long time. You know, Apple not interested in being first and as you know, they are interested in, in getting it right and then succeeding in that market. So, and listen, that has proved to be a very successful tactic and strategy for Apple. Can Apple do that again, Dan, in your opinion, when it comes to AI?
I think they can, right? I mean, look, as you said, they've done this again and again. They were not the first with music players. I think the Microsoft Zoom might have been before that, or maybe not the Zoom, but there were things like mini disc players that tried to, you know, make smaller music players, but then the iPod came out and it killed it. They weren't the first, uh, when it came to, uh, you know, smartphones, the idea of smartphones. Uh, there were ideas out there already, but they kind of just honed it and created the iPhone. And so same thing with, you know, wireless earbuds and smartwatches and fitness trackers, what have you. They've done this over and over and over again. And it, you know, it's their kind of MO where they let everyone trip over themselves getting out the, the, you know, the, the starting blocks, right? To be first. Uh, and then they kind of take their time and provide products that don't miss or more often than not, don't miss and give general, general utility to users. And I think that's what they're doing here, right? So, uh, some of the offerings that they have on include the ability to, uh, you know, create spreadsheets very quickly from recipes that you may have, and you need to scale that up, uh, for, for different aspects of, of what you maybe want to do is as far as parties go and things along those lines. So I think that those are really truly helpful rather than, you know, the whole idea of let's take pieces out of images. They also spent a lot of this event catching up, really. So they have, uh, Google has what's called circle of search. Samsung also offers it where you can circle something on your phone that you take a picture of or from your, your screen and then be able to search for it really quickly. Now Apple has that in their visual intelligence app, and that's a truly helpful feature. I use something like that on my own to, to search for something, a flower that I had seen, wanted to know if it was bad for my cats or not.
It turns out it was. Got it out of the house. This adds to that. So there, I think that that strategy could absolutely take off here. Wall Street obviously wants to see a big explosive, splashy announcement. They're not getting that yet. We'll see what happens when Siri comes out. And if Siri is even helpful as far as users go, are we going to want to use that on the daily, or is it just going to be something that we kind of, you know, use for a minute and then fall out of love with like the prior series? And then these smaller announcements become the more important ones.
We shall see. Still a lot of questions after this event. Dan, thank you. Appreciate it.",neutral,0

The company revealed a new design language called Liquid Glass, its most significant visual update since iOS 7 in 2013. The interface will roll out across iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Vision Pro devices starting later this year. Curved elements, translucent buttons, and animated interactions mark a departure from the sharp corners of older versions.
Apple said its in-house silicon now allows for richer visuals inspired by the Vision Pro interface. Apple Silicon has become dramatically more powerful, said software chief Craig Federighi.
However, the spotlight quickly shifted to what was missing. Apple did not provide a timeline for its long-awaited Siri overhaul powered by Apple Intelligence, originally teased last year but delayed in March. Federighi said only that this work needed more time to meet our high quality bar.
UBS analyst David Vogt called Apple's AI announcements incremental, noting many features are already available through competing platforms. He maintains a Hold rating on the stock.
Some new AI tools were shown like live phone call translations and ChatGPT image analysis integration but analysts said they fell short of rival offerings from OpenAI or Google.
Apple also announced a shift in software version names, moving from iOS 18 to iOS 26, matching the calendar year to simplify updates. The change applies across iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and visionOS as well.

Jobs ruled out acquisitions. He wasn't interested. Buffett then pivoted to buybacks.
""I would use it for repurchases if I thought my stock was undervalued,"" Buffett said he told Jobs. ""How do you feel about that?""
Jobs didn't hesitate.
""I think our stock's really undervalued,"" he replied. It was trading around $200.

These developments reflect the company's ongoing commitment to boosting user experience and technology integration. During the past month, Apple's share price experienced a modest 1.47% increase. This movement aligns closely with the general market trends, such as the gains in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, which also reached new highs. While the product announcements may have contributed positive momentum, Apple's legal battles, such as the Fintiv Inc. patent lawsuit, likely counterbalanced this effect.
We've identified 1 possible red flag for Apple that you should be aware of.
Find companies with promising cash flow potential yet trading below their fair value.
Apple's recent product announcements and the modest rise in its share price of 1.47% have contributed to shaping the current investment narrative. These updates, which focus on enhancing the user experience, are likely to support Apple's revenue and earnings forecasts by potentially boosting customer engagement and sales. Over the past five years, Apple's total shareholder return, including share price and dividends, was 141.68%. This long-term growth underscores the company's consistent ability to generate value for investors.
In contrast, over the past year, Apple's return has lagged behind the broader US market's performance, despite surpassing the US Tech industry. This relative performance contextualizes the recent short-term price movements and ongoing market dynamics affecting Apple. The company's forward-looking initiatives, such as the upcoming U.S. facility expansion and iPhone 16E launch, are expected to drive efficiencies and contribute to future revenue growth.
The current share price of US$198.51, while reflecting some positive expectations, remains approximately 14.5% below the consensus analyst price target of US$232.17. This suggests room for potential appreciation, contingent on the realization of revenue and margin improvements. The ongoing product advancements and strategic investments aim to bolster Apple's competitive position, aligning with analysts' projections of a revenue increase to US$473.5 billion and earnings growth to US$130.7 billion by 2028. However, external factors such as trade policy and legal challenges pose risks to these forecasts, requiring ongoing evaluation.

Jim Cramer isn’t impressed with Apple’s stock buybacks — Saylor offers a fix,"The stock buyback strategy isn't working for Apple, Jim Cramer says.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jim-cramer-isn-t-impressed-170935178.html,,AAPL,[],2025-06-10 17:09:35+00:00,,,"Jim Cramer isn’t impressed with Apple’s stock buybacks — Saylor offers a fixoriginally appeared onTheStreet.
CNBC's 'Mad Money' host and veteran market commentatorJim Crameris not impressed with Apple Inc. (Nasdaq: AAPL) repurchasing its stocks of late.
With a market cap of $3 trillion, Apple is the third-largest company in the world that is well-known for its flagship tech products such as iPhones, iPads, MacBooks, etc.
The tech giant has executed sizeable stock buybacks over the past few years.
On May 1, thecompany announcedits plan to repurchase up to $100 billion of its stock.
In 2024, it had bought back AAPL stocks worth $110 billion—the largest stock buyback in U.S. history.
In 2018, the company repurchased stocks worth $100 billion. Past buybacks include $75 billion in 2019, $50 billion in 2020, and $90 billion each in 2021, 2022, and 2023.
Cramer thinksthe buyback strategy isn't working for Apple:
""It is not a badge of dishonor. It just isn't""
Well, the analyst isn't entirely wrong. Though the AAPL stock has surged 236% over the last five years, 2025 has hardly been a kind year for it. The stock has declined nearly 20% in value year-to-date and was trading at $201.55 at press time.
BitcoinadvocateMichael Saylordidn't miss the opportunity to recommend the same investment advice to Apple that his business intelligence firm, Strategy (Nasdaq: MSTR), has been following since 2020.He wrote:
Apple should buy Bitcoin.
Strategy is the largest public corporate Bitcoin holder and co-founder Saylor often encourages other companies to follow the same acquisition plan as Strategy.
Elon Musk's automotive and clean energy companyTesla (Nasdaq: TSLA)andMetaplanet (Tokyo: 3350.T)are among other prominent public holders of Bitcoin.
Bitcoin, which the likes of Saylor have been counting on to earn impressive rewards, was trading at $109,635.11 at press time,as per Kraken.

Apple's upgraded AI models underwhelm on performance,"Apple has announced updates to the AI models that power its suite of Apple Intelligence features across iOS, macOS, and more. But according to the company's own benchmarks, the models underperform older models from rival tech firms, including OpenAI.

But according to the company's own benchmarks, the models underperform older models from rival tech firms, including OpenAI.
Applesaid in a blog postMonday that human testers rated the quality of text generated by its newest ""Apple On-Device"" model — which runs offline on products, including the iPhone — ""comparably"" to, but not better than, text from similarly sized Google and Alibaba models. Meanwhile, those same testers rated Apple's more capable new model, which is called ""Apple Server"" and is designed to run in the company's data centers, behind OpenAI's year-oldGPT-4o.
In a separate test evaluating the ability of Apple's models to analyze images, human raters preferred Meta's Llama 4 Scout model over Apple Server, according to Apple. That's a bit surprising. On a number of tests,Llama 4 Scoutperforms worse than leading models from AI labs like Google, Anthropic, and OpenAI.
The benchmark results add credence to reports suggesting Apple's AI research division has struggled to catch up to competitors in the cutthroat AI race. Apple's AI capabilities in recent years haveunderwhelmed, and a promised Siri upgrade has been delayed indefinitely. Some customershave sued Apple, accusing the firm of marketing AI features for its products that it hasn't yet delivered.
In addition to generating text, Apple On-Device, which is roughly 3 billion parameters in size, drives features like summarization and text analysis. (Parameters roughly correspond to a model’s problem-solving skills, and models with more parameters generally perform better than those with fewer parameters.) As of Monday, third-party developers can tap into it via Apple's Foundation Models framework.
Apple says both Apple On-Device and Apple Server boast improved tool use and efficiency compared to their predecessors, and can understand around 15 languages. That's thanks in part to an expanded training dataset that includes image data, PDFs, documents, manuscripts, infographics, tables, and charts.

What Apple didn't mention, however, was anything related to the tumultuous past few years for its developer community, or more broadly, why its developers should continue to put their trust in a company that's fighting them for every nickel and dime while failing them in other ways.
In recent years, the Cupertino-based tech giant has put its app developer community through the wringer as it stringently fought against regulation, lawsuits, and any otherefforts to rein in its alleged App Store monopolyby nations, lawmakers, and the courts.
Meanwhile, it has yet to deliver on some of the key technology advances that could modernize developers' apps for the AI era.
In March, itdelayedits ""more personalized,"" AI-powered Siri, demonstrated at last year's WWDC. Appleonly briefly acknowledged thisfumble during this year's keynote address, when SVP of Software Engineering Craig Federighi said the work ""needed more time"" to meet Apple's high bar.
At WWDC, Apple scattered mentions of AI related to features thatGoogle's AI already has, such as Apple'sAI-powered translation features, though it tried to differentiate from Google by offering lyrics translation in Apple Music. Apple's AI-powered Visual Intelligence feature was even demonstrated by tapping into Google's app for image search results, something that feels more native on Android devices with innovations likeCircle to Search,Lens' multisearch,visual search in videos, and more.
Elsewhere, Apple appeased developers' demand for AI with further integrations with OpenAI technology, like the addition ofChatGPT in Apple's Image Playground appandcoding assistance in Xcode.But no deals with other AI providers were announced, despiterumors that Google Gemini integrationwas on the way and that Apple wasteaming up with Anthropicon an AI-powered coding assistance tool.

Apple's software makeover was years in the making,Apple is overhauling all of its devices' operating systems.

The redesign, which focuses on a new aesthetic Apple calls Liquid Glass, is meant to make the company’s hardware feel new and exciting while providing a more streamlined interface. It’s an enormous change for the company’s massive user base, and one that Apple believes brings its software more in line with its hardware.
“I think as the devices have evolved themselves — larger screens, rounder bezels, higher resolution, HDR [high dynamic range] — there are these individual moments where we say, ‘Oh, we could change this in this way to take advantage of this. We could change this.’ But you realize, if you did it piecemeal, you're missing the opportunity to do something holistic and coherent,” Apple senior vice president of software engineering Craig Federighi said during a design roundtable.
“And when the opportunity to take Liquid Glass ... then all of its applications across the system, it suddenly allowed us to go back and answer many of those desires that had been built up as the software that we've been building, and the devices we've been building them on, had evolved over many years,” he added.
Apple last overhauled its iOS software in 2013 with iOS 7. While the company has been making steady updates and improvements throughout the years, including adding features like the Dynamic Island and changing its Control Center layout, among other things, its latest enhancements go beyond that.
Liquid Glass, as its name sounds, makes various elements of Apple’s software look as though they’re made out of glass. App icons, menus, and the clock on your phone’s lock screen all have a translucent glass-like look. Scroll through a web page in Safari, and the address bar will refract and warp the content below it as if it’s passing beneath a sheet of acrylic.
The new design also cleans up some of the feature bloat that has crept into Apple’s app interfaces over the years. The Camera app now prominently features just the Photo and Video options, rather than the variety of camera functions in the current app.
You can still access those additional options with a quick tap, but whittling them down to Photo and Video should make quickly snapping a picture or shooting a video far easier.
Of course, making such wide-ranging changes to Apple’s software platforms is a risky move considering how many people use the company's products each day. That’s something Alan Dye, Apple’s vice president of human interface design, said the company was acutely aware of from the start.",neutral,0

The improvements are part of the company's iPadOS 26, which Apple announced during itsWWDC 2025 conference on Monday. They include upgraded multitasking capabilities that will allow people to use the iPad more like a Mac and less like an iPhone.
It's an enormous departure from Apple's previous strategy, which saw the company hold off on adding too many multitasking features to its iPad line out of fear of cannibalizing its MacBook Air.
The updates include the ability to use windowed versions of apps that you can move and resize just as you would on a Mac. Previously, apps could only be resized in certain instances, and apps snapped to specific areas of the iPad's screen.
Now, you'll be able to layer apps on top of each other and have even more of them slightly offscreen to make room for other apps.
Apple also added a new menu bar at the top of the iPad's screen where you can access options like app-specific commands, similar to the Mac. The company also updated its Files app, so you can navigate your saved documents, videos, and photos more easily. And Apple is finally bringing the Preview app to the iPad for when you need to quickly access a PDF file or photo.
The sweeping changes are all part of Apple's iPadOS 26, which includes the company's new Liquid Glass design language and a number of Apple Intelligence features such as live translation in the Phone, FaceTime, and Messages apps.
Apple's iPad segment is its smallest business, bringing in $26.6 billion of the company's $391 billion intotal revenue in 2024, down 6% year over year. The iPhone brought in $201.1 billion, while the Mac generated $29.9 billion. The software update, however, could give consumers a bigger reason to choose an iPad over a MacBook Air, helping to goose sales.
Still, the move isn't exactly a death knell for the Air. A full-size laptop still offers more performance and flexibility than a tablet. And customers looking for more powerful systems will continue to opt for the MacBook Pro.

This outlook is primarily driven by ""pulled forward Apple demand due to tariffs.""
According to Citi’s China Technology analyst, data points from Asia suggest that the Apple supply chain could see improved performance.
Furthermore, the ""Asia supply chain currently expects 80-95M or stable Y/Y growth for iPhone 17 build.""
Citi highlights that ""Apple supply chain stocks historically outperform AAPL stock from WWDC through iPhone launch event in September.""
Given these factors, Citi sees ""upside risk to Jun/Sep-Q results on pulled forward Apple demand due to tariffs"" for both companies, with earnings serving as the primary catalyst within the next 90 days.
Apple accounts for a significant portion of both companies’ total sales, contributing approximately 66% to Skyworks Solutions’ last reported quarter total sales, and about 47% to Qorvo’s fiscal year 2025 total sales.
Despite the short-term positive outlook, Citi maintains its ""long-term concerns around increasing RF semis competition and concentration risk"" for these suppliers.
However, the immediate prospect of tariff-driven demand acceleration positions both Qorvo and Skyworks Solutions for potential upside in the near term.

Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference keynote Monday delivered ""slow but steady improvements to strategy,"" Wedbush analysts said, “but overall [it was] a yawner.""
The event introduced an iOS update with some new features, but did not provide a specific timeline on AI-powered Siri features that investors had been waiting for.
Shares of Apple have lost roughly a fifth of their value in 2025 amid concerns over the impact of tariffs and fears the iPhone maker is falling behind in the AI race.

Apple (AAPL) is late to the artificial intelligence party. That’s what Wedbush analysts said after the company’s Worldwide Developers Conference keynotedidn’t include a specific timelinefor AI-enhanced Siri features that investors had been waiting for.
The iPhone maker “is playing it safe and close to the vest after the missteps last year,” Wedbush wrote, referencing an ambitious presentation atWWDC 2024that showcased a supercharged Siri assistant handling more complex tasks using AI. Apple Senior Vice President of Software Engineering Craig Federighi said during Monday's keynote that there’s more work to do, and that more information will be released in the coming year.
Still, Apple did plant the seeds of its AI strategy by releasing a software development kit that will allow developers to build apps using the large language models within Apple Intelligence, Wedbush noted. The WWDC keynote showcased ""slow but steady improvements to strategy,"" the analysts said. ""But overall [it was] a yawner.""
Goldman Sachs analysts said that while the lack of Siri updates “may have been underwhelming,” incremental improvements such as the new “liquid glass” iOS redesign and features like AI-powered live translation should help keep users from switching to competitors’ hardware.
Wedbush and Goldman maintained bullish price targets of $270 and $253, respectively. Meanwhile, UBS reiterated its $210 target, and JPMorgan stayed at $240. Apple shares lost about 1% Monday after the WWDC keynote, and were little changed in recent trading Tuesday near $203.
Shares of Apple have struggled this year, falling by roughly a fifth in 2025 amid concerns over theimpact of tariffsand fears Apple could be falling behind in the AI race. Last month, ChatGPT maker OpenAI took what could be seen as a step toward competing with Apple in offering AI devices with plans toacquire io, an AI startup launched by former Apple design head Jony Ive.

BlackRock Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley are among firms scaling up a strategy known as tax-loss harvesting, typically offered through customized portfolios called separately managed accounts. When markets drop, managers sell stocks trading below their purchase price to realize losses. Those losses offset gains elsewhere in a portfolio, reducing clients’ tax liabilities while maintaining overall portfolio exposure.
The approach allows investors to shrink their current-year IRS bills while deferring capital gains into the future. In April’s selloff, for example, a manager could dump Home Depot Inc. and rotate into Lowe’s Cos Inc., maintaining sector exposure while staying inside tax rules.
Once a boutique service reserved only for the ultra-rich, investment firms are repackaging market turbulence as a fiscal opportunity, with automated trading programs scanning portfolios daily as equity conditions shift. With fee pressure eroding revenue in traditional asset management, Wall Street is leaning more heavily on tax-optimization trades to differentiate offerings, retain clients and defend margins in a competitive marketplace.
“There is just inherently going to be more volatility in the system,” said Scott Smith, senior director at industry consultant Cerulli Associates. “With trade policies, tariffs, taxes, everything is on the table. There is no assumption of what the future looks.”
In one particularly active stretch during April’s selloff, BlackRock’s Aperio, a platform for personalized portfolios, executed more than $18 billion in trades. That generated $700 million in realized losses that can be used to offset taxable gains elsewhere in client portfolios, or so-called tax-loss harvesting. That equated to roughly $5 to $7 in losses realized for every $100 traded that month.
“We monitor daily. We look at losses and high-cash positions. We balance harvesting with managing tracking error,” said Ran Leshem, who oversees BlackRock’s separately managed account business, now managing $220 billion. “Our goal is to be the market leader in SMAs.”",neutral,0

Apple announcing significant software updates at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference including changes to iPhones, iPads, Macs, and watches. Joining us now, Ramon Llamas. He is IDC researchers director of Mobile Devices and AR and VR. Thank you so much for joining us this morning. Just curious what you make of the announcements that we are getting so far? What stands out to you as the biggest announcement so far?
I I I think there's two major major, you know, results coming out of this. Uh, number one is, you know, Apple's move for greater cohesion. If you look at its products and, more importantly, its operating systems, you know, you have one for the Mac, you have one for the iPhone, you have one for the iPad, and so on and so forth. Now, Apple's taking a really smart move to bring more closer together, a lot more cohesive than what we've seen in the past. And when you're kind of a user who lives within that Apple ecosystem, um, you can shift rather quickly and rather easily, uh, going from one product to the next. And to do so in a way that the experience is just a lot more seamless and fluid and more intuitive. And that's not to say that the current paradigm is not any of those things. Absolutely, it is, but it just makes that much simpler. You know, that's that's going to be a feather in Apple's cap. Um, the other thing is what we didn't see. And what we didn't see is like a whole, you know, a whole bunch of steps where Apple really embraces that AI hype. Okay, we know for the last year or so that Apple's been kind of been the laggard behind the Googles and the Metas and some of the other companies out there saying, okay, you know, we're not going to be the first, um, but we are going to take our time. We're going to make it the best possible experience, even if it's going to take some time. So I I think Apple's really just positioning itself for future success instead of saying here, go out and get, you know, these OS upgrades and products immediately.
Okay, so it doesn't sound like this is going to drive any massive super cycle.
Not yet. Not yet. Okay. Because remember this is a developer conference. It's not so much a device, uh, you know, announcements. But here's the thing. You know, I think Apple made another smart move when I was talking about cohesion earlier is that when they rename its operating systems according to the year because we saw iOS 26. We saw iPad OS 26. You know, that is a really good sign for end users to say, okay, you know, am I on the most current one? And chances are, and this is my bet, that come September, you know, the devices will take a similar route. We're not going to get, you know, iPhone 17, 18, 19, et cetera. We're probably going to iPhone 26, 27, 28 and so on and, you know, going forward. I think it's a small and subtle way to nudge that user to say, okay, you know, you, here comes the new operating system. How old is the device that you have right now? Maybe it's time to upgrade. So I think, you know, are we seeing anything for the hype cycle? No, but I think there's some subtle ways to get people to move onward and upwards to the next device and operating system eventually.
I'm just curious, if you had a single adjective to describe these updates thus far, what it would be. We had Laura Martin with Needham already calling the event disappointing. What would you describe it as?
No, I, it may be disappointing to some because there wasn't any huge whizzbang type of announcements, and I kind of get that. But if there's one thing that, you know, I would describe it as is a, you know, a very calculated move by Apple, okay? Uh, if you take a look at that entire AI race, and we can talk about the other companies that are really moving forward and placing big bets. But here's the thing, you know, according to a lot of the surveys that we put together, Joe and Jane Consumer on Main Street USA, they acknowledge the presence of AI on these devices, but they're not really quite there in terms of, hmm, what's the value here? What is, you know, what is the point? What am I going to say? How do I benefit? And so Apple taking, because of its position in the market across multiple devices, you know, taking a very calculated stance not to rush into things and let all the other companies kind of suffer those slings and arrows of where things go well and where things don't go well and ultimately what gets adopted. Um, I think Apple takes a very calculated approach saying, okay, we know AI is there, and we're going to be there too, but we want to make sure that this is a very polished and ready for primetime experience before releasing.",neutral,0
Here’s why Citi says Apple stock is ’set up well’ for 2026,"Investing.com -- Citi analysts maintained their Buy rating on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in a note Tuesday, arguing the stock is ""set up well"" for 2026, primarily due to ""a major revamp of its software designs across Apple platforms, new operating systems, and Apple Intelligence updates"" showcased at the recent 2025 WWDC.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-citi-says-apple-stock-140807539.html,,AAPL,[],2025-06-10 14:08:07+00:00,,,"Investing.com -- Citi analysts maintained their Buy rating on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in a note Tuesday, arguing the stock is ""set up well"" for 2026, primarily due to ""a major revamp of its software designs across Apple platforms, new operating systems, and Apple Intelligence updates"" showcased at the recent 2025 WWDC.
Citi said it liked the new and ""more unified ’Liquid Glass’ design across all platforms,"" along with ""continued improvement on Vision Pro, the more Mac-like iPadOS and more iPhone apps on MacOS for continuity.""
They particularly like ""how Apple Intelligence is deeply integrated in apps across Apple devices,"" even acknowledging that investor focus remains on the ""previously delayed personalized Siri update to 2026.""
Despite these software advancements, Citi kept its iPhone unit forecasts at ""226/234M in 2025/26, or –0.6%/3.2% Y/Y growth.""
They anticipate ""some pull-in in the Jun-Q given temporary pause on reciprocal tariffs in China and other countries, and pending Section 232 decisions, with more uncertainties in the 2H.""
Regarding iPhone demand in China, Citi notes that, according to CAICT, China’s April total smartphone shipment was down 1.6% year-over-year.
However, ""foreign mobile phone (mostly iPhone) outperformed by growing 1% y/y.""
Citi believes that combining this with ""aggressive promotions during 618 shopping festival and likely tariffs related pull-in,"" China iPhone sales ""could stabilize in the Jun-Q.""
They also highlight that the past March quarter was the first time Apple saw ""flattish China sales in constant currency basis.""

CoreWeave has nearly quadrupled since its heavily downsized initial public offering in March. Palantir is up more than 460% over the past year. Investors may hope that the shares will perform like Nvidia Corp., whose stock soared at the start of the artificial intelligence era. The risk is that they act more like retailer GameStop Corp. — now 66% below a 2021 peak.
“Investors are ignoring fundamentals just to jump on the trend, and if you stretch a rubber band, the snapback can be substantial,” said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers Group. “You need fresh money to reinforce the trend, otherwise the moves aren’t sustainable.”
Shares of CoreWeave fell 5.8% on Tuesday while Palantir slipped 0.4%.
Hints of such risks came last week, when cloud-computing provider CoreWeave tumbled 17% out of the blue, its biggest one-day drop on record. The shares since recovered and neared a fresh high on Monday.
CoreWeave and Palantir are among this year’s best-performing stocks amid a resurgence of the AI trade as tech giants continue to spend heavily on computing infrastructure. CoreWeave rents cloud-computing capacity and counts Microsoft Corp. as one of its biggest customers. Palantir makes data analysis software used by governments and commercial customers.
Representatives for CoreWeave and Palantir did not immediately respond to Bloomberg News requests for comment.
In contrast to GameStop, a video-game retailer that faced real challenges during the pandemic, both are clearly benefiting from strong demand for their services. CoreWeave’s revenue is expected to more than double this year, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Palantir’s is projected to increase by 36%, aided by brisk sales of its AI offerings.
The problem is whether investors are over-paying for that growth. Palantir trades at 71 times estimated sales, making it by far the most expensive stock in the S&P 500. CoreWeave, which had a net loss of $315 million in the first quarter, is priced at 10 times projected sales. The average in the S&P 500 is around 3 times.",neutral,0

While the S&P 500 trading near record high, investors are awaiting tomorrow's CPI print and any updates on trade as key catalysts to drive further gains for stocks.

Plus negotiators for the US and China are meeting for a second day of discussions in London. Prior to the meeting, President Trump told reporters that talks are going well, but China is quote not easy. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessette and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick are leading the discussions focused on reestablishing terms of an agreement reached in Geneva last month, including more rare earth shipments to the US and the US removing recent measures targeting certain goods on China, including semiconductors.

The updates include the ability to use windowed versions of apps that you can move and resize just as you would on a Mac. Previously, apps could only be resized in certain instances and and apps snapped to specific areas of the iPad's screen.
Now, you'll be able to layer apps on top of each other and have even more of them slightly offscreen to make room for other apps.

Apple also added a new menu bar at the top of the iPad's screen where you can access options like app-specific commands, similar to the Mac. The company also updated its Files app, so you can navigate your saved documents, videos, and photos more easily. And Apple is finally bringing the Preview app to the iPad for when you need to quickly access a PDF file or photo.
Apple's iPad segment is its smallest business, bringing in $26.6bn (£19.7bn) of the company's $391bn intotal revenue in 2024, down 6% year over year. The iPhone brought in $201.1 billion, while the Mac generated $29.9bn. The software update, however, could give consumers a bigger reason to choose an iPad over a MacBook Air, helping to goose sales.

iOS 26 is also introducing other useful features, including major improvements tothe way the iPhone handles phone calls, a dedicated gaming app, enhancements to its artificial intelligence offerings, updates to Messages and Maps, and more.
However, while Apple has now showcased iOS 26, not everyone can get their hands on it yet. Some can download iOS 26 today, while others will need to wait until later in the summer—or into the fall. Here’s when and how you can download iOS 26.
Apple unveiled iOS 26 at itsannual Worldwide Developers Conference(WWDC) on Monday, June 9. That day, the company made what is known as the iOS 26 Developer Beta immediately available for download onto iPhones.
However, as the “developer beta” moniker suggests, this version of iOS 26, which is now available, is only accessible to registered Apple developers. The good news is that anyone can register for theApple Developer Program(membership costs $99 per year). But unless you’re an actual developer, it’s best to stay clear of the iOS 26 Developer Beta.
The reason for this is that developer betas are notoriously buggy. In fact, one of the primary purposes of a beta program is to allow users to identify and report bugs, enabling Apple to fix them before the software is released to the general public. And some bugs can be nasty—leading to lost data or even damaged devices.
That’s why, unless you are an actual developer making apps for iOS, it’s best to steer clear of the iOS 26 Developer Beta.
The good news is you don’t have to be a developer to beta test iOS 26. Apple also offers a public Apple Beta Software Program that allows anyone who signs up for it to get early access to beta software, including iOS 26.
This iOS 26 beta, released through the Apple Beta Software Program, is colloquially known as the “iOS 26 Public Beta.” This beta is generally safer to use than the Developer Beta, as Apple releases it after it has had the chance to fix some of the critical bugs that developers report finding in the Developer Beta.",neutral,0

This partnership is part of several new AI-powered features set to be introduced in iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26, and visionOS 26.
The publication said that while AI was not the primary focus of the event, these advancements will help Apple align more closely with features offered by Samsung and Google's Android devices.
Among the notable AI features is On-Screen Content, which will allow Apple's Visual Intelligence to analyse images and text on an iPhone's screen.
Users can ask ChatGPT for more information and search Google for similar images or products.
Another feature, Live Translation, will be integrated into Apple's Messages, Phone, and FaceTime apps.
This feature will facilitate conversations across different languages, with text messages and replies being automatically translated.
The Apple Watch will exclusively feature Workout Buddy, an AI-generated voiced coach that provides feedback on exercise benchmarks and fitness goals.
Initially, it will be available in English and limited to specific workout types like running and cycling.
Apple's new software will also introduce Genmoji, enabling users to combine two emoji for creative expression.
Using Apple's Image Playground, customers can access ChatGPT to transform images into styles such as oil painting or vector art.
Image Playground also allows for easy adjustments to expressions or personal attributes.
In the Messages app, Apple Intelligence will suggest when polls might be useful in group chats, and users can create custom chat backgrounds.
The Wallet app will be enhanced to have features, including summarising order tracking details from emails, serving as a central hub for deliveries.
Developers will benefit from the on-device Apple Intelligence foundation model, which enables AI-powered capabilities such as natural language search in apps.
These features work offline, eliminating cloud-computing costs.
In May 2025, reports of Apple working oncustom-designed chipsaimed at powering future smart glasses, AI servers, and upcoming Mac models surfaced.

Warren Buffett has nearly 23% ofBerkshire Hathaway's portfolio invested in two artificial intelligence (AI) stocks: 21.8% is allocated toApple(NASDAQ: AAPL), a stock that soared 600% in the last decade, and 0.8% is allocated toAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), a stock that soared 900% in the last decade.
Here's what investors should know about Apple and Amazon.
The investment thesis for Apple has two parts. First, the company is the global leader in smartphone sales, a position it achieved through engineering expertise that spans hardware and software. Apple has cultivated a significantbrand moatthat affords the company great pricing power but must maintain its premium status with consumers to be a worthwhile investment.
Second, Apple aims to monetize its installed base exceeding 2.35 billion devices with add-on services like iCloud storage, Apple Care, Apple Pay, and App Store content, as well as subscription products like Apple TV+. Within the services segment, many analysts expect Apple to eventually monetize artificial intelligence.
To elaborate, late last year, the company introduced Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI features that CEO Tim Cook said would usher in a ""new era for the iPhone."" Apple Intelligence was initially free, but many analysts speculated Apple would eventually monetize more sophisticated features as a subscription offering.
However, consumers have been relatively unmoved by the platform. In fact, iPhone sales have essentially been flat over the last six months despite many pundits predicting a massive upgrade cycle. One reason for the lackluster response may be the absence of the much-touted upgrades to the conversational assistant Siri, including the ability to understand personal context and take action within other apps.
In May, Bloomberg reported that internal data showed Apple was years behind the competition in terms of developing a ChatGPT competitor, and the timeline for the Siri upgrades is still unknown. ""The planned rollout was delayed until May and then indefinitely, even as features were still being promoted on commercials for the iPhone 16,"" according to Bloomberg.",neutral,0

Apple’s big developer summit is a Silicon Valley institution. The company has been hosting it every year since 1983, and in more recent years the events have become a fixture of the tech hype machine — a chance for Apple to show off its latest software to investors and the folks who build apps for those products.
Look, they can’t all be bangers.
The Worldwide Developers Conference comes around every 12 months, like the Super Bowl or the Oscars. And sometimes it feels like an Important Cultural Moment. Other times it feels like we’re just going through the paces and putting on a little show for the fans. This year’s WWDC was more the latter. (But it was far from, like, a “‘Crash’ beats ‘Brokeback Mountain’”-level disaster.)
The buzziest elements seemed totally fine. Groundbreaking? No. But cute and user-friendly in all the ways we expect from Apple.
Design nerds are twittering about “Liquid Glass,” iOS’s gloopy visual update, but that’s about as controversial as this WWDC got. (TL;DR, Liquid Glass is like the T-1000 from “Terminator II” — it’s all shapeshifty and, well,gloopy, compared with the earlier, more rigid design language. If transparent gradients rile you up, maybe it was a spicier WWDC from your vantage point.)
Of course, Apple’s investors wanted a bit more pizazz. And in particular, they wanted to see Apple make more progress on the souped-up Sirithe company promisedat last year’s WWDC.
That didn’t happen.
In fact, Siri was barely mentioned apart from an early nod from Craig Federighi, Apple’s software lead, who said: “We’re continuing our work to deliver the features that make Siri even more personal… This work needed more time to reach our high-quality bar, and we look forward to sharing more about it in the coming year.”
That’s the polite way of saying, “Yeah, yeah, about that AI revolution we promised — we’re working on it.”
Apple’s stock (AAPL), which is down 17% this year, tumbled a few minutes into Monday’s event. Shares fell 1.2% Monday.
Apple certainly brought the hype last year, leading some analysts to predict that the AI upgrades would spura long awaited “super-cycle”of iPhone users upgrading their devices.
But a few months on, it became clear that Apple Intelligence, the company’s proprietary AI, wasn’t ready for prime time. The smarter Siri never arrived, and Appleshelved it indefinitelyearlier this year. Apple also had to roll back its AI-powered text message summaries, which werehilariousbut ultimately not a great look.",neutral,0

As of this writing on June 6,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL)is valued at an astonishing $3 trillion. It's not surprising that to get to this point, its shares have rocketed higher, to the tune of 14,830% just in the past two decades.
There is perhaps no company on the face of the planet that is more closely watched than Apple. As a result, investors probably feel that they generally have a thorough understanding of the tech giant. But there's more than meets the eye.
Think you know Apple? Here's one little-known fact you can't overlook.
The world knows Apple as the purveyor of the most beautifully designed tech gadgets. These days, the iPhone, iPad, MacBook, Watch, and AirPods get all the attention. Before, it was the iPod that was the talk of the town.
Innovation has always been a core part of Apple's DNA, and this was delivered to users in physical form. According to CEO Tim Cook, there are 2.4 billion active Apple devices (as of January) around the globe, showcasing that the products truly are everywhere.
In recent years, though, there's another segment that investors need to pay closer attention to. I'm talking about the services division. In Q2 2025 (ended March 29), services brought in $26.6 billion of revenue, translating to 28% of the company's total. This fact might not be on the radar of a lot of investors.
That sales figure was up 11.3% year over year and 34.3% compared to Q2 2022. The growth rate is much better than what's being achieved in the more mature products segment. In fact, product revenue dropped 11.4% in the last three years. In the future, the share of sales coming from services is likely to expand, just as it has in the past.
There are a lot of services that Apple offers. Advertising, AppleCare, iCloud, App Store, Arcade, Fitness+, Music, News+, TV+, Card, and Pay are all included here. Apple has leveraged its broad distribution, literally sitting in the pockets of consumers worldwide, to layer on services. This segment reported an incredible 75.7%gross marginin Q2.
Besides driving faster growth and better profitability, services create a key competitive advantage for Apple, which is its powerful ecosystem. Users are essentially locked into theApple's walled garden.",positive,1

Nvidia's massive growth is unheard of for a company of its size.
10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›
The $3 trillion stock club isn't a big list; it's justNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA),Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), andApple(NASDAQ: AAPL).Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN)is the fourth-largest company in the world, but it is currently valued at around $2.2 trillion, which showcases how large a gap there is between third and fourth place.
Of this $3 trillion trio, is there any worth owning right now? After all, they're already quite large; could they get even bigger?
Apple and Microsoft are easily the most recognizable companies of this trio. Many people use Apple products daily, whether it's an iPhone or some other hardware Apple creates. Microsoft is similar, as many people utilize one of the Microsoft Office products at work. However, Microsoft is a much broader company than that, as its variouscloud computing productsmake up a significant amount of the company's revenue.
Nvidia is even more obscure, as few people interact with the bulk of Nvidia's products. You may have an Nvidia graphics card in your laptop or PC, but the bulk of Nvidia's revenue comes from its data center graphics processing units (GPUs), which have been widely deployed to train and run AI models. Nvidia has a dominant hold on this market, with most estimates stating that Nvidia's market share is greater than 90%.
These three businesses have dominated their respective industries, which makes sense, as only the best rise to the top. However, I think these three companies will take very different paths over the next five years, with one company clearly being the best buy.
From a revenue standpoint, Apple is the largest company, but that gap closes when profits are considered.
However, one notable thing is that Nvidia is still significantly smaller than the other two, despite being the largest company in the world currently. That's because Nvidia has one thing that the others don't: growth.
Although Nvidia's growth has started to slow a bit, it's still incredibly rapid.
Next quarter also looks promising for Nvidia, with revenue expected to rise 50% year over year. Part of this slowdown can be attributed to the U.S. government banning exports to China of its H20 chip, which was specially designed to meet old regulations. Still, 50% growth is nothing to be worried about, as it showcases the strong demand for Nvidia's products.",positive,1

The race to the top of theartificial intelligence(AI) mountain is on, and the usual suspects are in the running. Two of the top AI companies today are also two of the stocks in theBerkshire Hathawayportfolio.
Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL)is one of Warren Buffett's favorite companies, and he's called it a better business than his other favorites,Coca-ColaandAmerican Express. It's the largest position in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio, accounting for 21.6% of the total.
Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), on the other hand, was purchased by one of Berkshire Hathaway's investment managers, not Buffett himself, although Buffett has admitted his admiration for founder Jeff Bezos. Amazon stock accounts for only 0.8% of the portfolio.
It's clear which company works better for Buffett, but which one is better for your portfolio?
Many investors know thatBuffett loves an undervalued stock. But when explaining how he chooses stocks, he calls himself a business picker, not a stock picker. When explaining what he loves in a great business, he invariably talks about moats and capital deployment.
""I didn't go into Apple because it was a tech stock in the least,"" he explained when he first bought it. ""I mean, I went into Apple because I...came to certain conclusions about both the intelligence with which the capital would be employed, but more important, about the value of an ecosystem and how permanent that ecosystem could be, and what the threats were to it, and a whole bunch of things.""
To explain how he thinks, he said that even though he made a mistake by not buyingAlphabetback when it was still Google, he saw that it had displaced an earlier search engine called Alta Vista and figured it could be displaced, as well. In other words, at the time, it wasn't clear that it would have the moat that it has today, essentially making it impossible for any competition to come close to its status in the near term.
However, Buffett has said that, to have a moat that's investment-worthy, ""You have to have some very, very, very special product, and which has a...widespread ecosystem, and the product's extremely sticky, and all of that sort of thing."" Apple's AI is all about reinforcing its ecosystem to keep its loyal customers. It's another way the consumer-tech giant enhances its ecosystem and becomes even more sticky.",neutral,0

The American tech giant was struck by a sell-off on Monday evening after it became apparent that its keynote presentation, led by chief executive Tim Cook, would only include minor software upgrades.
Investors sent the stock price down by as much as 1.9pc during the presentation, wiping as much as $65.3bn (£48bn) off its market capitalisation.
It comes amid growing frustration over Apple’s failure to keep up with rivals on cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) developments.
Last month, Apple’s former chief designer Sir Jony Iveseemingly took aim at the company, hitting out at the “legacy” products on the market and the “decades old” technology within them.
Sir Jony was speaking as he announced he was joining artificial intelligence rival OpenAI, in a $6.5bn (£4.8bn) deal expected to create a new generation of devices that could challenge the iPhone
On Monday night, Apple put great emphasis on a range of visual improvements it is making to all of its operating systems. It said iPads would now be able work like traditional Mac computers, with apps able to run in windows.
However, Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said the event was “overall a yawner” and that investors’ patience was “wearing thin”.
It follows years of setbacks for Apple as it battles to compete on artificial intelligence. While it was one of the first Silicon Valley companies to embrace AI with itsvoice assistant Siri, rivals have since rapidly overtaken its technology.
Last month, Mr Cook admitted on an earnings call that “we need more time to complete our work on [improved Siri] features so they meet our high-quality bar”.
On Monday, Apple failed to announce any major AI updates for Siri. Reports have suggested that progress has been hampered by complications updating Siri using large language models.
The most notable AI announcement at the annual showcase was that it would give software developers access to the AI technology that is built into recent Apple devices.
Craig Federighi, Apple’s software chief, said: “We think this will ignite a whole new wave of intelligent experiences in the apps users rely on every day. We can’t wait to see what developers create.”
The company introduced a live translation feature to phone calls. Customers will be able to speak in England to a French person and then hear their words read out in French.
Apple said it would also have a call screening feature that will work like a personal assistant, automatically answering calls from unknown people and asking them for information so that a customer can decide whether to take the call.",negative,-1

Alan Dye, Apple’s vice president of human interface, is slated to discuss the transition at the conference. The “Liquid Glass” interface is also expected to lay the groundwork for new hardware products, including a 20th-anniversary iPhone, internally known as the “Glasswing”, which is set to launch in 2027.
The “Glasswing” will boast curved glass sides and incredibly slim bezels. The Liquid Glass interface is considered the highlight of this year’s developer conference.
Besides the interface revamp, Apple is gearing up for its annual back-to-school offer, which is set to kick off on June 17. The tech giant is also planning to broaden iPhone carrier promotions in its retail stores from June 26.
The introduction of the “Liquid Glass” interface marks a significant milestone in Apple’s design evolution. This shift not only enhances the visual appeal of Apple’s software but also paves the way for future hardware innovations.
The anticipation surrounding the 20th-anniversary iPhone, coupled with the new interface, underscores Apple’s commitment to maintaining its leading edge in the tech industry.
